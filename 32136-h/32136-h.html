The Treatise on Relics by the great Reformer of Geneva is
not so generally known as it deserves, though at the time
of its publication it enjoyed a considerable popularity.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
The probable reason of this is: the absurdity of the relics
described in the Treatise has since the Reformation gradually
become so obvious, that their exhibitors make as little
noise as possible about their miraculous wares, whose virtues
are no longer believed except by the most ignorant
part of the population of countries wherein the education
of the inferior classes is neglected. And, indeed, not only
Protestants, but many enlightened Roman Catholics believed
that all the miracles of relics, images, and other
superstitions with which Christianity were infected during
the times of mediæval ignorance would be soon, by the
progress of knowledge, consigned for ever to the oblivion
of the dark ages, and only recorded in the history of the
aberrations of the human mind, together with the superstitions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Unfortunately
these hopes have not been realised, and are still
remaining amongst the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pia desideria</span></span>. The Roman Catholic
reaction, which commenced about half a century ago by
works of a philosophical nature, adapted to the wants of
the most intellectual classes of society, has, emboldened by
success, gradually assumed a more and more material
tendency, and at length has begun to manifest itself by
such results as the exhibition of the holy coat at Treves,
which produced a great noise over all Germany,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> the apparition
of the Virgin at La Salette, the winking Madonna
of Rimini, and, what is perhaps more important than all,
the solemn installation of the relics of St Theodosia at
Amiens; whilst works of a description similar to the Life
of St Francis of Assisi, by M. Chavin de Malan, and the
Lives of the English Saints, which I have mentioned on
pp. <a href="#Pg113" class="tei tei-ref">113</a> and <a href="#Pg115" class="tei tei-ref">115</a>
of my Introduction are produced by writers
of considerable talent and learning. These are significant
facts, and prove, at all events, that in spite of the progress
of intellect and knowledge, which is the boast of our
century, we seem to be fast returning to a state of things
similar to the time when Calvin wrote his Treatise. I
therefore believe that its reproduction in a new English
translation will not be out of date.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other side, the politico-religious system of aggression
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagev">[pg v]</span><a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
followed by Russia has now taken such a rapid
development, that the dangers which threaten the liberties
and civilization of Europe from that quarter have become
more imminent than those which may be apprehended
from the Roman Catholic reaction. Fortunately England
and France have taken up arms against the impious
crusade proclaimed by the Imperial Pope of Russia. I
think that the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impious</span></em>, which I am advisedly using
on this occasion, is by no means exaggerated; because,
how can we otherwise designate the proceedings adopted
by the Czar for exciting the religious fanaticism of the
Russians, as, for instance, the letter of the Archbishop of
Georgia, addressed to that of Moscow, and published in
the official Gazette of St Petersburg, stating, on the
authority of the Russian General, Prince Bagration Mukhranski,
that during an engagement between the Russians
and the Turks, which recently took place in Asia, the
Blessed Virgin appeared in the air and frightened the
Turks to such a degree that they took to flight!<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> I have
developed this subject in the last chapter of my Introduction,
in order to show my readers the religious condition
of the Russian people, because I think that without
it a knowledge of the policy now followed by their
Government cannot be well understood, or its consequences
fully appreciated.

The valuable Dissertation which forms such a fitting
commentary upon John Calvin's Treatise on Relics, was
written by the late lamented author on the eve of the
Crimean War, in 1854. It has been out of print for several
years, but in these days of Popish assumption and claims
to Infallibility, it has been thought that a new edition
would prove acceptable, and be found useful in directing
attention to the mummeries and absurdities engrafted on
the True Christian Faith, by the false and corrupt Church
of Rome.

The Christian Church.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hero-worship is innate to human nature, and it is
founded on some of our noblest feelings,—gratitude,
love, and admiration.—but which, like all other feelings,
when uncontrolled by principle and reason, may
easily degenerate into the wildest exaggerations, and
lead to most dangerous consequences. It was by such
an exaggeration of these noble feelings that Paganism
filled the Olympus with gods and demigods,—elevating
to this rank men who have often deserved
the gratitude of their fellow-creatures, by some signal
services rendered to the community, or their admiration,
by having performed some deeds which required
a more than usual degree of mental and physical
powers. The same cause obtained for the Christian
martyrs the gratitude and admiration of their fellow-Christians,
and finally converted them into a kind of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
demigods. This was more particularly the case when
the church began to be corrupted by her compromise
with Paganism, which having been baptized
without being converted, rapidly introduced into the
Christian church, not only many of its rites and ceremonies,
but even its polytheism, with this difference,
that the divinities of Greece and Rome were
replaced by Christian saints, many of whom received
the offices of their Pagan predecessors.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> The church
in the beginning tolerated these abuses, as a temporary
evil, but was afterwards unable to remove
them; and they became so strong, particularly during
the prevailing ignorance of the middle ages, that
the church ended by legalising, through her decrees,
that at which she did nothing but wink at first. I
shall endeavour to give my readers a rapid sketch
of the rise, progress, and final establishment of the
Pagan practices which not only continue to prevail
in the Western as well as in the Eastern church,
but have been of late, notwithstanding the boasted
progress of intellect in our days, manifested in as
bold as successful a manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nothing, indeed, can be more deserving of our
admiration than the conduct of the Christian martyrs,
who cheerfully submitted to an ignominious death,
inflicted by the most atrocious torments, rather than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deny their faith even by the mere performance of
an apparently insignificant rite of Paganism. Their
persecutors were often affected by seeing examples
of an heroic fortitude, such as they admired in a
Scævola or a Regulus, displayed not only by men,
but by women, and even children, and became
converted to a faith which could inspire its confessors
with such a devotion to its tenets. It has been
justly said that the blood of the martyrs was the glory
and the seed of the church, because the constancy
of her confessors has, perhaps, given her more converts
than the eloquence and learning of her doctors.
It was, therefore, very natural that the memory of
those noble champions of Christianity should be
held in great veneration by their brethren in the faith.
The bodies of the martyrs, or their remnants, were
always, whenever it was possible, purchased from
their judges or executioners, and decently buried by
the Christians. The day on which the martyr had
suffered was generally marked in the registers of his
church, in order to commemorate this glorious event
on its anniversaries. These commemorations usually
consisted in the eulogy of the martyr, delivered in an
assembly of the church, for the edification of the faithful,
the strengthening of the weak, and the stimulating
of the lukewarm, by setting before them the
noble example of the above-mentioned martyr. It
was very natural that the objects of the commemoration
received on such an occasion the greatest praises,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not unfrequently expressed in the most exaggerated
terms, but there was no question about invoking the
aid or intercession of the confessors whose example
was thus held out for the imitation of the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We know from the Acts that neither St Stephen,
the first Christian martyr, nor St James, who was
killed by Herod, were invoked in any manner by the
apostolic church, because, had this been the case,
the inspired writer of this first record of the ancient
church would not have omitted such an important
circumstance, having mentioned facts of much lesser
consequence. Had such a practice been in conformity
with the apostolic doctrine, it would have
certainly been brought forward in the epistles of St
Paul, or in those of other apostles. There is also
sufficient evidence that the fathers of the primitive
church knew nothing of the invocation, or any other
kind of worship rendered to departed saints. The
limits of this essay allow me not to adduce evidences
of this fact, which may be abundantly drawn
from the writings of those fathers, and I shall content
myself with the following few but conclusive instances
of this kind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St Clement, bishop of Rome, who is supposed to
have been instituted by St Paul, and to be the same
of whom he speaks in his Epistle to the Philippians
iv. 3, addressed a letter to the Corinthians on account
of certain dissensions by which their church
was disturbed. He recommends to them, with great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
praises, the Epistles of St Paul, who had suffered martyrdom
under Nero, but he does not say a word
about invoking the aid or intercession of the martyr,
who was the founder of their church, and which would
have been most suitable on that occasion, if such a
practice had already been admitted by the Christians
of his time. On the contrary, he prays God for
them, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because it is He who gives to the soul that
invokes Him, faith, grace, peace, patience, and wisdom</span></em>.”</span>
St Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who lived in
the second century, addressed a letter to the Philippians,
but he says nothing in it to recommend the
invocation of St Paul, who was the founder of their
church, and as such would have been considered as
its patron saint, had the worship of the saints been
at that time already introduced amongst the Christians.
The most important and positive proof that
the primitive Christians, not only did not pay any
adoration to the martyrs, but decidedly rejected it, is
the epistle which was issued by the church of Smyrna
after the martyrdom of its bishop, whom I have just
mentioned. It states that the Pagans had, at the instigation
of the Jews, closely watched the Christians,
imagining that they would endeavour to carry away
the ashes of Polycarp in order to worship him after
his death, because these idolaters knew not that the
Christians cannot abandon Jesus Christ, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or worship
any one else</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">We worship</span></em>,”</span> says the same document,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God</span></em>; but with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
regard to the martyrs, the disciples of Christ and imitators
of his virtues, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we love them, as they deserve
it, on account of the unconquerable love which they
had for their Master and King; and would to God
that we should become their disciples and partakers
of their zeal</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I could multiply proofs of this kind without end,
but I shall only observe, that even in the fourth century
the orthodox Christians considered the worship
of every created being as idolatry, because the opponents
of the Arians, who considered Jesus Christ as
created and not co-essential with God the Father, employed
the following argument to combat this dogma:—<span class="tei tei-q">“If
you consider Jesus Christ a created being, you
commit idolatry by worshipping him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Admiration is, however, akin to adoration, and it
was no wonder that those whose memory was constantly
praised, and frequently in the most exaggerated
terms, gradually began to be considered as something
more than simple mortals, and treated accordingly.
It was also very natural that various objects
which had belonged to the martyrs were carefully
preserved as interesting mementoes, since it is continually
done with persons who have acquired some
kind of celebrity, and that this should be the case
with their bodies, which have often been embalmed.
It is, however, impossible, as Calvin has justly observed,<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
to preserve such objects without honouring
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them in a certain manner, and this must soon degenerate
into adoration. This was the origin of the
worship of relics, which went on increasing in the
same ratio as the purity of Christian doctrines was
giving way to the superstitions of Paganism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worship of images is intimately connected
with that of the saints. They were rejected by the
primitive Christians; but St Irenæus, who lived in
the second century, relates that there was a sect of
heretics, the Carpocratians, who worshipped, in the
manner of Pagans, different images representing
Jesus Christ, St Paul, and others. The Gnostics had
also images; but the church rejected their use in a
positive manner, and a Christian writer of the third
century, Minutius Felix, says that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Pagans reproached
the Christians for having neither temples
nor simulachres;”</span> and I could quote many other evidences
that the primitive Christians entertained a
great horror against every kind of images, considering
them as the work of demons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It appears, however, that the use of pictures was
creeping into the church already in the third century,
because the council of Elvira in Spain, held in
305, especially forbids to have any picture in the
Christian churches. These pictures were generally
representations of some events, either of the New or
of the Old Testament, and their object was to instruct
the common and illiterate people in sacred
history, whilst others were emblems, representing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some ideas connected with the doctrines of Christianity.
It was certainly a powerful means of producing
an impression upon the senses and the imagination
of the vulgar, who believe without reasoning,
and admit without reflection; it was also the
most easy way of converting rude and ignorant
nations, because, looking constantly on the representations
of some fact, people usually end by believing
it. This iconographic teaching was, therefore, recommended
by the rulers of the church, as being useful
to the ignorant, who had only the understanding of
eyes, and could not read writings.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> Such a practice
was, however, fraught with the greatest danger, as
experience has but too much proved. It was replacing
intellect by sight.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> Instead of elevating man
towards God, it was bringing down the Deity to
the level of his finite intellect, and it could not but
powerfully contribute to the rapid spread of a pagan
anthropomorphism in the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was also another cause which seems to have
greatly contributed to the propagation of the abovementioned
anthropomorphism amongst the Christians,
namely, the contemplative life of the hermits,
particularly of those who inhabited the burning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deserts of Egypt. It has been observed of these
monks, by Zimmerman, in his celebrated work on
Solitude, that <span class="tei tei-q">“men of extraordinary characters,
and actuated by strange and uncommon passions,
have shrunk from the pleasures of the world into
joyless gloom and desolation. In savage and dreary
deserts they have lived a solitary and destitute life,
subjecting themselves to voluntary self-denials and
mortifications almost incredible; sometimes exposed
in nakedness to the chilling blasts of the winter cold,
or the scorching breath of summer's heat, till their
brains, distempered by the joint operation of tortured
senses and overstrained imagination, swarmed
with the wildest and most frantic visions.”</span><a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> The
same writer relates, on the authority of Sulpicius
Severus, that an individual had been roving about
Mount Sinai nearly during fifty years, entirely naked,
and avoiding all intercourse with men. Once, however,
being inquired about the motives of his strange
conduct, he answered, that, <span class="tei tei-q">“enjoying as he did the
society of seraphim and cherubim, he felt aversion
to intercourse with men.”</span><a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many of these enthusiasts imagined, in their hallucinations,
they had a direct intercourse with God
himself, who, as well as the subordinate spirits, appeared
to them in a human shape. The monks of
Egypt were, indeed, the most zealous defenders of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the corporeality of God. They violently hated Origines
for his maintaining that He was spiritual.
Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, opposed this error;
but the monks assembled in great force, with the
intention of murdering him; and he escaped this
danger by addressing them in the words which Jacob
used to Esau, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have seen thy face, as though I had
seen the face of God.”</span>—(Gen. xxxiii 10.) This compliment,
which could be interpreted as an acknowledgment
of a corporeal God, appeased the wrath of
the monks, but they compelled Theophilus to anathematise
the writings of Origines.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following anecdote is characteristic of the
strong tendency of human nature towards anthropomorphism.
An old monk, called Serapion, having
been convinced by the arguments of a friend that it
was an error to believe God corporeal, exclaimed,
weeping, <span class="tei tei-q">“Alas, my God was taken from me, and I
do not know whom I am now worshipping!”</span><a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> I shall
have, in the course of this essay, opportunities to show
that the monks have always been the most zealous
and efficient promoters of image-worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following rapid sketch of the introduction of
image-worship into the Christian church, and of its
consequences, has been drawn by a French living
writer, whose religious views I do not share, but
whose profound erudition, fairness, and sincerity, are
deserving of the greatest praise:—
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The aversion of the first Christians to the images,
inspired by the Pagan simulachres, made room, during
the centuries which followed the period of the
persecutions, to a feeling of an entirely different
kind, and the images gradually gained their favour.
Reappearing at the end of the fourth and during
the course of the fifth centuries, simply as emblems,
they soon became images, in the true acceptation of
this word; and the respect which was entertained by
the Christians for the persons and ideas represented
by those images, was afterwards converted into a
real worship. Representations of the sufferings which
the Christians had endured for the sake of their religion,
were at first exhibited to the people in order
to stimulate by such a sight the faith of the masses,
always lukewarm and indifferent. With regard to
the images of divine persons of entirely immaterial
beings, it must be remarked, that they did not originate
from the most spiritualised and pure doctrines
of the Christian society, but were rejected by the
severe orthodoxy of the primitive church. These
simulachres appear to have been spread at first by
the Gnostics,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, by those Christian sects which
adopted the most of the beliefs of Persia and India.
Thus it was a Christianity which was not purified
by its contact with the school of Plato,—a Christianity
which entirely rejected the Mosaic tradition,
in order to attach itself to the most strange and attractive
myths of Persia and India,—that gave birth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the images. And it was a return to the spiritualism
of the first ages, and a revival of the spirit of
aversion to what has a tendency of lowering Divinity
to the narrow proportions of a human creature, that
produced war against those images. But the manners
and the beliefs had been changed. Whole nations
had received Christianity, when it was already
escorted by that idolatrous train of carved and
painted images. Only those populations amongst
whom the ancient traditions were preserved could
favour this reaction. The clergy were, moreover,
interested in maintaining one of their most powerful
means of teaching. The long and persevering efforts
of the Iconoclasts proved therefore ineffective; and
the Waldenses were not more fortunate. Wickliffe,
the Hussites, and Carlostad, attacked the images;
but it was reserved only to the Calvinists to establish
in some parts of Europe the triumph of the
ideas of the Iconoclasts. The shock was terrible.
The Religionists frequently committed acts of a fanatical
and senseless vandalism; and art had many
losses to deplore. But the idolatrous tendency was
struck at its very root; and Catholicism itself found,
after the struggle, more purity and idealism in its
own worship.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> The Reformed perceived afterwards
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the exaggeration of their principles; and though
they continued to defend the entrance of their
temples to the simulachres, condemned by God on
Mount Sinai, they spared those which had been
bequeathed by the less severe and more material
faith of their fathers.”</span><a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principal cause of the corruption of the Christian
church, by the introduction of the Pagan ideas
and practices alluded to above, was, however, chiefly
the lamentable policy of compromise with Paganism
which that church adopted soon after her sudden
triumph by the conversion of Constantine. The
object of this policy was to lead into her pale the
Pagans as rapidly as possible; and, therefore, instead
of making them enter by the strait gate, she widened
it in such a manner, that the rush of Paganism had
almost driven Christianity out of her pale. The
example of the emperors, who, professing Christianity,
were, or considered themselves to be, obliged,
by the necessities of their position, to act on
some occasions as Pagans, may have been not without
influence on the church. I shall endeavour to
develop this important subject in the following chapters;
and, in order to remove every suspicion of partiality,
I shall do it almost entirely on the authority
of an eminent Roman Catholic writer of our day.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have described, in the preceding chapter, the
causes which made Christian worship gradually to
deviate from its primitive purity, and to assume a
character more adapted to the ideas of the heathen
population,—numbers of whom were continually
joining the church. It was, particularly since the
time of Constantine, because its festivals, becoming
every day more numerous, and its sanctuaries more
solemn, spacious, and adorned with greater splendour,—its
ceremonies more complicated,—its emblems
more diversified,—offered to the Pagans an
ample compensation for the artistic pomp of their
ancient worship. <span class="tei tei-q">“The frankincense,”</span> says an eminent
Roman Catholic writer of our time, <span class="tei tei-q">“the flowers,
the golden and silver vessels, the lamps, the crowns,
the luminaries, the linen, the silk, the chaunts, the
processions, the festivals, recurring at certain fixed
days, passed from the vanquished altars to the triumphant
one. Paganism tried to borrow from Christianity
its dogmas and its morals; Christianity took
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from Paganism its ornaments.”</span><a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> Christianity would
have become triumphant without these transformations.
It would have done it later than it did, but
its triumph would have been of a different kind from
that which it has obtained by the assistance of these
auxiliaries. <span class="tei tei-q">“Christianity,”</span> says the author quoted
above, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">retrograded</span></em>; but it was this which made
its force.”</span> It would be more correct to say, that it
advanced its external progress at the expence of its
purity; it gained thus the favour of the crowd, but
it was by other means that it obtained the approbation
of the cultivated minds.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The church made a compromise with Paganism
in order to convert more easily its adherents,—forgetting
the precepts of the apostle, to beware of philosophy
and vain traditions, (Col. ii. 8,) as well as to
refuse profane and old wives' fables, (1 Tim. iv. 7.)
And it cannot be doubted that St Paul knew well
that a toleration of these things would have rapidly
extended the new churches, had the quantity
of the converts been more important than the quality
of their belief and morals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This subject has been amply developed by one of
the most distinguished French writers of our day,
who, belonging himself to the Roman Catholic
Church, seeks to justify her conduct in this respect,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though he admits with the greatest sincerity that
she had introduced into her polity a large share of
Pagan elements. I shall give my readers this curious
piece of special pleading in favour of the line of
policy which the church had followed on that occasion,
as it forms a precious document, proving, in an
unanswerable manner, the extent of Pagan rites and
ideas contained in the Roman Catholic Church,
particularly as it proceeds, not from an opponent of
that church, but from a dutiful son of hers. The
work from which I am making this extract is, moreover,
considered as one of the master-pieces of modern
French literature, and it was crowned by one
of the most learned bodies of Europe—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Academie
des Inscriptions et des Belles Lettres</span></span> of Paris.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The fundamental idea of Christianity,”</span> says our
author, <span class="tei tei-q">“was a new, powerful idea, and independent
of all those by which it had been preceded. However,
the men by whom the Christian system was
extended and developed, having been formed in the
school of Paganism, could not resist the desire of
connecting it with the former systems. St Justin,
St Clement (of Alexandria), Athenagoras, Tatian,
Origenes, Synesius, &amp;c., considered Pagan philosophy
as a preparation to Christianity. It was, indeed,
making a large concession to the spirit of the ancient
times; but they believed that they could conceal its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inconveniences by maintaining in all its purity the
form of Christian worship, and rejecting with disdain
the usages and ceremonies of polytheism.
When Christianity became the dominant religion,
its doctors perceived that they would be compelled
to give way equally in respect to the external
form of worship, and that they would not be sufficiently
strong to constrain the multitude of Pagans,
who were embracing Christianity with a kind of
enthusiasm as unreasoning as it was of little duration,
to forget a system of acts, ceremonies, and
festivals, which had such an immense power over
their ideas and manners. The church admitted,
therefore, into her discipline, many usages evidently
pagan. She undoubtedly has endeavoured to
purify them, but she never could obliterate the impression
of their original stamp.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This new spirit of Christianity—this eclectism,
which extended even to material things—has in
modern times given rise to passionate discussions;
these borrowings from the old religion were condemned,
as having been suggested to the Christians
of the fourth and fifth centuries by the remnants of
that old love of idolatry which was lurking at the
bottom of their hearts. It was easy for the modern
reformers to condemn, by an unjust blame, the leaders
of the church; they should, however, have acknowledged,
that the principal interest of Christianity
was to wrest from error the greatest number of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its partisans, and that it was impossible to attain
this object without providing for the obstinate adherents
of the false gods an easy passage from the
temple to the church. If we consider that, notwithstanding
all these concessions, the ruin of Paganism
was accomplished only by degrees and imperceptibly,—that
during more than two centuries it
was necessary to combat, over the whole of Europe,
an error which, although continually overthrown,
was incessantly rising again,—we shall understand
that the conciliatory spirit of the leaders of the
church was true wisdom.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“St John Chrysostom says, that the devil, having
perceived that he could gain nothing with the Christians
by pushing them in a direct way into idolatry,
adopted for the purpose an indirect one.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> If the
devil, that is to say, the pagan spirit, was changing
its plan of attack, the church was also obliged to
modify her system of defence, and not to affect an
inflexibility which would have kept from her a great
number of people whose irresolute conscience was
fluctuating between falsehood and truth.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Already, at the beginning of the fifth century,
some haughty spirits, Christians who were making
a display of the rigidity of their virtues, and
who were raising an outcry against the profanation
of holy things, began to preach a pretended
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reform; they were recalling the Christians to the
apostolic doctrine; they demanded what they were
calling a true Christianity. Vigilantius, a Spanish
priest, sustained on this subject an animated contest
with St Jerome. He opposed the worship of the
saints and the custom of placing candles on their
sepulchres; he condemned, as a source of scandal,
the vigils in the basilics of the martyrs,<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> and many
other usages, which were, it is true, derived from the
ancient worship. We may judge by the warmth
with which St Jerome refuted the doctrines of this
heresiarch of the importance which he attached to
those usages.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> He foresaw that the mission of the
Christian doctrine would be to adapt itself to the
manners of all times, and to oppose them only
when they would tend towards depravity. Far from
desiring to deprive the Romans of certain ceremonial
practices which were dear to them, and
whose influence had nothing dangerous to the Christian
dogmas, he openly took their part, and his conduct
was approved by the whole church.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If St Jerome and St Augustinus had shared the
opinions of Vigilantius, would they have had the
necessary power successfully to oppose the introduction
of pagan usages into the ceremonies of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christian church? I don't believe that they
would. After the fall of Rome, whole populations
passed under the standards of Christianity, but they
did it with their baggage of senseless beliefs and
superstitious practices. The church could not repulse
this crowd of self-styled Christians, and still less summon
them immediately to abandon all their ancient
errors; she therefore made concessions to circumstances,
concessions which were not entirely voluntary.
They may be considered as calculations full of wisdom
on the part of the leaders of the church, as well as the
consequence of that kind of irruption which was made
at the beginning of the fifth century into the Christian

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Romans had derived from their religion an
excessive love of public festivals. They were unable
to conceive a worship without the pompous apparel
of ceremonies. They considered the long processions,
the harmonious chaunts, the splendour of dresses,
the light of tapers, the perfume of frankincense, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the essential part of religion. Christianity, far from
opposing a disposition which required only to be
directed with more wisdom, adopted a part of the
ceremonial system of the ancient worship. It
changed the object of its ceremonies, it cleansed
them from their old impurities, but it preserved the
days upon which many of them were celebrated,
and the multitude found thus in the new religion,
as much as in the old one, the means of satisfying
its dominant passion.</span><a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The neophytes felt for the pagan temples an
involuntary respect. They could not pass at once
from veneration to a contempt for the monuments
of their ancestors' piety; and in ascending the steps
of the church, they were casting a longing look on
those temples which a short time before had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
resplendent with magnificence, but were now deserted.
Christianity understood the power of this
feeling, and desired to appropriate it to its own service;
it consented, therefore, to establish the solemnities
of its worship in the edifices which it had disdained
for a long time.<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> Its care not to offend

which, since the times of Constantine, was always to
facilitate the conversion of the Pagans, assumed,
after the fall of Rome, a more decided character,
and the system of useful concessions became general
in all the churches of Europe; and it cannot be
doubted that its results have been favourable to the
propagation of Christian ideas.</span><a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“There is, moreover, a peculiar cause to which the
rapid decline of the pagan doctrines in the west
must be ascribed, and I shall endeavour to place
this powerful cause in its true light, carefully avoiding
mixing up with a subject of this importance all
considerations foreign to the object of my researches.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople, after having
defended a long time the true faith, strayed from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it on a subject which proved a stumbling-stone to
so many theologians—I mean, the nature of Jesus
Christ. Nestorius distinguished in the Son of God
two natures, a divine and a human one; and he
maintained that the Virgin Mary was not the mother
of God (Θεοτοκος), but the mother of the man
(ἀνθρωποτοκος). This doctrine, which was a new and
bolder form given to Arianism, spread in the two
empires, and gained a great number of partisans
amongst the monasteries of Egypt. Many monks
could not almost suffer that Jesus Christ should be
acknowledged as God, and considered him only as
an instrument of the Divinity, or a vessel which bore it (Θεοφορος).</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The celebrated St Cyrillus, bishop of Alexandria,
wrote an epistle to those monks, in order to call
them back to respect for the traditions established
in the church, if not by the apostles—who,
in speaking of the holy virgin, never made use of
the expression, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother of God</span></em>—at least by the
fathers who succeeded them. The quarrel became
general and violent; the Christians came to blows
everywhere. Nestorius seemingly wished to draw
back, being frightened by the storm which he had
himself raised. <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have found,’</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
church a prey to dissensions. Some call the holy
virgin the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother of God</span></em>; others only the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother
of a man</span></em>. In order to reunite them, I have called
her the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother of Christ</span></em>. Remain, therefore, at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
peace about this question, and be convinced that my
sentiments on the true faith are always the same.’</span>
But his obstinacy and the ardour of his partisans
did not allow him to go beyond this false retraction.
The necessity of a general council was felt,
and the Emperor Theodosius II. ordered in 431 its
convocation at Ephesus. On the 21st June 431,
two hundred bishops condemned Nestorius, and declared
that the Virgin Mary should be honoured
as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother of God</span></em>. This decision was accepted,
notwithstanding some vain protestations, by the
universal church. The fathers of the council of
Ephesus had no thought of introducing into the
church a new dogma or worship. The Virgin
Mary had always been considered by them as the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mother of God</span></em>, and they made now a solemn declaration
of this belief, in order to reply to the attack
of Nestorius, and to remove every incertitude about
a dogma which had not hitherto been opposed.
But these great assemblies of Christians, notwithstanding
the particular motive of their meeting,
were always produced by some general necessity
which was felt by the Christian society, and the results
of their decrees went often beyond the provisions
of those by whom they were framed.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Though I am far from believing that it is allowable
to weigh in the scales of human reason the

prohibited to examine which of these dogmas has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been the most instrumental in detaching the Pagans
from their errors.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We have several times penetrated, in the course
of our researches, into the conscience of the leaders
of Paganism, and we have always found that it
was entirely under the influence of political views
and interests. These interests, which so powerfully
acted upon the politician's mind, had but a feeble
hold upon that of the inhabitants of the country.
And, indeed, what interest could the agriculturists,
the artisans, and the proletarians, have in maintaining
the integrity of the Roman constitution, or
in preserving the rights of the senate, as well as the
privileges, honours, and riches of the aristocracy?
Being destined, as they were under any religion whatever,
for a life of labour and privation, they might
choose between Christianity and Paganism, without
having their choice actuated by any personal interest.
It is therefore necessary to seek for another
cause of that obstinate attachment which the lower
classes of the town and country population showed
for the practices of a worship whose existence
was for a century reduced to such a miserable
state.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“I shall not dwell on what has been said about the
tyranny of habit, which is always more severe wherever
minds are less enlightened. I shall indicate
another cause of the obstinacy of the Pagans, which
was founded at least upon an operation of the mind—upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a judgment—and was, consequently, more
deserving of fixing the attention of the church than
that respect of custom against which the weapons
of reason are powerless.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Christian dogmas, penetrating into a soul
corrupted and weakened by idolatry, must have, in
the first moment, filled it with a kind of terror. And,
indeed, how was it possible that the Pagans, accustomed
as they were to their profligate gods and
goddesses, should not have trembled when they
heard for the first time the voice of God, the just
but inexorable rewarder of good and evil? Should
not a solemn and grave worship, whose ceremonies
were a constant and direct excitation to the practice
of every virtue, appear an intolerable yoke to men
who were accustomed to find in their sacred rites a
legitimate occasion to indulge in every kind of debauchery?
The fear of submitting their lives to the
rule of a too rigid morality, and to bow their heads
before a God whose greatness terrified them, kept
for many years a multitude of Pagans from the
church.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If it has entered the designs of Providence to
temper the severe dogmas of Christianity by the
consecration of some mild, tender, and consoling
ideas, and by the same adapted to the fragile human
nature, it is evident that, whatever may have been
their aim, they must have assisted in detaching the
last Pagans from their errors. The worship of Mary,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the mother of God, seems to have been the means

Christianity.</span><a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“After the council of Ephesus the churches of
the East and of the West offered the worship of
the faithful to the Virgin Mary, who had victoriously
issued from a violent attack. The nations
were as if dazzled by the image of this divine
mother, who united in her person the two most
tender feelings of nature, the pudicity of the virgin
and the love of the mother; an emblem of mildness,
of resignation, and of all that is sublime in virtue;
one who weeps with the afflicted, intercedes for the
guilty, and never appears otherwise than as the messenger
of pardon or of assistance. They accepted
this new worship with an enthusiasm sometimes too
great, because with many Christians it became the
whole Christianity. The Pagans did not even try to
defend their altars against the progress of the worship
of the mother of God; they opened to Mary the
temples which they kept closed to Jesus Christ, and
confessed their defeat.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> It is true, that they often

mixed with the worship of Mary those pagan ideas,
those vain practices, those ridiculous superstitions,
from which they seemed unable to detach
themselves; but the church rejoiced, nevertheless,
at their entering into her pale, because she well knew
that it would be easy to her to purge of its alloy,
with the help of time, a worship whose essence was
purity itself.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> Thus, some prudent concessions,

Alps.”</span><a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>

Paganism, And Their Policy In This
Respect.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have given in the preceding chapter a description,
traced by one of the most learned Roman Catholic
writers of our day, of the compromise between Christianity
and Paganism, by which the church has endeavoured
to establish her dominion over the adherents
of the latter. I shall now try to give a rapid
sketch of the circumstances which undoubtedly have
influenced the church, to a considerable degree, in
the adoption of a line of policy which, though it
certainly has much contributed to the extension of
her external dominion, has introduced into her pale
those very errors and superstitions which it was her
mission to destroy, and to deliver mankind from
their baneful influence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a widely-spread but erroneous opinion,
that the conversion of Constantine was followed by
an immediate destruction of Paganism in the Roman
empire. This opinion originated from the incorrect
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
statements of some ecclesiastical writers; but historical
criticism has proved, beyond every doubt, that,
even a century after the conversion of that monarch,
Paganism was by no means extinct, and counted
many adherents, even amongst the highest classes
of Roman society.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Constantine proclaimed his conversion to
the religion of the Cross, its adherents formed but a
minority of the population of the Roman empire.<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>
The deficiency of their numbers was, however, compensated
by their moral advantages; for they were
united by the worship of the one true God, and ardently
devoted to a religion which they had voluntarily
embraced, and for which they had suffered so
much. The Pagans were, on the contrary, disunited,
and in a great measure indifferent to a religion whose
doctrines were derided by the more enlightened of
them, though, considering it as a political institution
necessary for the maintenance of the empire,
they often displayed great zeal in its defence. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christians of that time may be compared to the
Greeks when they combated the Persians on the
field of Marathon and at Thermopylæ; but, alas!
their victory under Constantine proved as fatal to
the purity of their religion as that of the Greeks
under Alexander to their political and military virtues.
Both of them became corrupted by adopting
the ideas and manners of their conquered adversaries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some writers have suspected that the conversion of
Constantine was more due to political than religious
motives; but though great and many were the faults
of that monarch, his sincerity in embracing the Christian
religion cannot be doubted, because it was a
step more contrary than favourable to his political
interests. The Christians formed, as I have said
above, only a minority of the population of the empire,
and particularly so in its western provinces.
There was not a single Christian in the Roman senate;
and the aristocracy of Rome, whose privileges and
interests were intimately connected with the religious
institutions of the empire, were most zealous in their
defence. The municipal bodies of the principal
cities were also blindly devoted to the national religion,
whose existence was considered by many as inseparable
from that of the empire itself; and these
bodies were generally the chief promoters of those
terrible persecutions to which the Christians had been
so many times subjected. The Pagan clergy, rich,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
powerful, and numerous, were ever zealous in exciting
public hatred against the Christians; and the
legions were chiefly commanded by those officers who
had united with Galerius in compelling Diocletian to
persecute the Christians. The capital of the empire
was the particular stronghold of the ancient creed.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Rome,”</span> says Beugnot, in the work from which I
have so largely drawn, <span class="tei tei-q">“was the cradle and the
focus of the national belief. Many traditions, elevated
to the rank of dogmas, were born within her pale,
and impressed upon her a religious character, which
still was vividly shining in the times of Constantine.
The Pagans of the west considered Rome
as the sacred city, the sanctuary of their hopes, the
point towards which all their thoughts were to be
directed; and the Greeks, in their usual exaggeration,
acknowledged in her, not a part of the earth, but of
heaven.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Libanii Epistolæ</span></span>, epist. 1083, p. 816.)
<span class="tei tei-q">“The aristocracy, endowed with its many sacerdotal
dignities, and dragging in its train a crowd of clients
and freedmen, to whom it imparted its passions and
its attachment to the error, furnished, by the help
of its immense riches, the means of subsistence
to a greedy, turbulent, and superstitious populace,
amongst whom it could easily maintain the most odious
prejudices against Christianity. The hope of acquiring
a name, a fortune, or simply to take a part
in the public distributions, attracted to that city from
the provinces all those who had no condition, or,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what is still worse, those who were dissatisfied with
theirs. Italy, Spain, Africa, and Gallia sent to
Rome the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">elite</span></span> of their children, in order to be instructed
in a school, the principal merit of whose professors
was, an envious hatred of every new idea, and
who had acquired a melancholy reputation during
the persecutions of the Christians. The standard of
Paganism was waving in full liberty on the walls of
the Capitol. Public and private sacrifices, sacred
games, and the consultation of the augurs, were prevailing to the utmost in that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sink of all the
superstitions</span></em>.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> The name of Christ was cursed, and the
speedy ruin of his worshippers announced, in every
part of that place, whilst the glory of the gods was
celebrated, and their assistance invoked. How cruel
must have been the situation of the Christians, left
in the midst of that city, where, at every step, a
temple, an altar, a statue, and horrible blasphemies
were revealing to them the ever active power of the
Lie! They dared not either to found churches, to
open schools, or even publicly to reply to what was
spoken against them, at the theatres, at the forum,
or at the baths: so that they seemed to exist at
Rome only in order to give a greater <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eclat</span></span> to the
dominion of idolatry.”</span>—(Vol. i., p. 75.) It was no
wonder that such a religious disposition of Rome had
placed it in a continual and strenuous opposition to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Constantine, and his Christian successors; and this
circumstance may be considered as an additional motive
which induced Constantine to transfer the capital
of the empire from Rome to Byzantium, though this
measure may have been chiefly brought about by political
considerations. In removing his residence to a
more central point of the empire, he at the same time
drew nearer to the eastern provinces, where Christianity
had many devoted adherents. Constantinople
became the capital of the Christian party, whence it
gradually developed its sway over the other parts of
the empire, but the Pagans maintained meanwhile
their ground at Rome, in such a manner, that it
seems to have been uninhabitable to the Christian
emperors; because we see even those of them who
ruled the western provinces fixing their residence
either at Milan or Ravenna, and visiting only on some
occasions the city of the Cæsars, which had become,
since the foundation of Constantinople, the fortified
camp of Paganism.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Constantine proclaimed full religious liberty to
all his subjects. This measure, dictated by a sound
policy, and in perfect harmony with the true spirit
of his new religion, was not, however, sufficient to
relieve him from the difficulties of his personal position,
as he united in his person two characters diametrically
opposed one to another. Being a Christian,
he was at the same time, as the emperor of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Rome, the head and the representant, not only of
its political, but also of its religious institutions. This
circumstance forced him into a double line of policy,
which I shall describe in the words of M. Beugnot:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There were in Constantine, so to say, two persons,—the
Christian and the emperor. If that monarch
had not been endowed with a rare intellect,
he would have, by confounding these two characters,
raised in his way obstacles which he could not overcome.
As a Christian, he showed everywhere his
contempt for the vain superstitions of the ancient
worship, and his enthusiasm for the new ideas. He
conferred with the bishops; he assisted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">standing</span></em> at
their long homilies; he presided at the councils; he
deeply meditated the mysteries of Christianity; and
he struggled against the heresiarchs with the ardour
of a Christian soldier and the grief of a profoundly
convinced soul. As emperor, he submitted to the
necessities of a difficult position, and conformed, in
all grave matters, to the manners and beliefs which
he did not feel sufficiently strong openly to shock.
On endowing the purple, he became the heir of that
long series of emperors who had all remained faithful
to the worship of the father-land; and he wrapt
himself, so to say, in the ancient traditions and recollections
of pagan Rome; for it was an inheritance
which he could not renounce, without danger to
himself as well as to the empire.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When we observe some actions of Constantine,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
evidently tinged with Paganism, we must consider
less their external form than the relation in which
they stood towards the constitution of Rome, which
that emperor had no desire to destroy. We shall
then become convinced that his conduct was the
result of necessity, and not that of a crooked policy.
As an individual, he was free; as an emperor, he
was a slave; and his greatest merit, according to our
opinion, was to have soundly judged the embarrassments
of this situation. Animated as he was with
a lively zeal for the truths of Christianity, it was
very natural that he should employ the imperial
power in order to break down all the obstacles to its
progress. But this would have involved him in an
open war with a nation, the majority of whom were
composed of Pagans; and it is very likely that he
would have succumbed in such a contest. He understood
this; and it prevented him giving way to
the entreaties, and even complaints, of over-zealous
Christians.”</span>—Vol. i., p. 88.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Constantine was, notwithstanding his conversion
to Christianity, the supreme pontiff of pagan Rome.
The title of this dignity was given him on the public
monuments, and he performed its functions on
several occasions; as, for instance, in 321, several
years after his conversion, he wrote to Maximus, prefect
of Rome, as follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If our palace or any public monument shall be
struck by lightning, the auguries are to be consulted,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
according to the ancient rites (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">retento more veteris
observantiæ</span></span>), in order to know what this event indicates;
and the accounts of these proceedings are immediately
to be sent to us. Private individuals may
make similar consultations, provided they abstain
from secret sacrifices, which are particularly prohibited.
With regard to the accounts stating that
the amphitheatre was recently struck by lightning,
and which thou hast sent to Heraclianus the tribune,
and master of offices, know that they must be
delivered to us.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is undoubtedly a very strange document for
a Christian monarch, who officially commands to consult
the Pagan oracles, and, as its concluding words
seem to imply, is anxious to maintain, on similar occasions,
his rights as the supreme pontiff of Paganism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was also in his quality of supreme pontiff
that Constantine instituted, soon after his accession,
the Francic games, for the commemoration of his
victory over the Franks, and which were celebrated,
during a considerable time, on the 18th of the kalends
of August; and, in 321, the Sarmatic games,
on the occasion of his victory over the Sarmatians,
and celebrated on the 6th of the same month.

I could quote other instances of a similar kind;
but I shall conclude this subject by observing, that a
medal has been preserved, upon which Constantine

Constantine was, indeed, very anxious not to offend
the Pagan party. In 319 he published a very
severe law against the soothsayers; expressing, however,
that this prohibition did not extend to the
public consultations of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Haruspices</span></span>, according to
the established rites. And a short time afterwards
he proclaimed another law on the same subject, in
which he still more explicitly declares that he does
not interfere with the rites of the Pagan worship.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a>

It must be observed, that the Romans, as well as
the Greeks, had two kinds of divination: the public,
which were considered as legitimate; and the secret,
which were generally forbidden. This last had been
prohibited by some former emperors; and the laws
of the Twelve Tables declared them punishable with
death. Constantine seems to have been very anxious
that his intention on this subject should not be mistaken;
and he published in 321 an edict, by which
he positively allows the practice of a certain kind of
magic, by the following remarkable expressions:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is right to repress and to punish, by laws
justly severe, those who practise, or try to practise,

the magical arts, and seek to seduce pure souls into
profligacy; but those who employ this art in order
to find remedies against diseases, or who, in the
country, make use of it in order to prevent the
snow, the wind, and the hail from destroying the
crops, must not be prosecuted. Neither the welfare
nor the reputation of any one are endangered by
acts whose object is to insure to men the benefits of

This was, undoubtedly, a very large concession to
the superstitions of Paganism made by a Christian
monarch, and from which he was, perhaps, himself
not entirely free. It is well known that Constantine,
after his public declaration of Christianity, introduced
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">labarum</span></span>,<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> as a sign of the dominion
of the new faith; but it was generally placed on his
coins in the hands of the winged statue of the Pagan
goddess of Victory. Besides these coins of Constantine,
there are many others of the same monarch,
having inscriptions in honour of Jupiter, Mars, and
other Pagan divinities. The Pagan aristocracy of
Rome seem to have been resolved to ignore the
fact that the head of the empire had become a
Christian, and to consider him, in spite of himself,
as one of their own. Thus, after his death, the
senate placed him, according to the usual custom,
among the gods; and a calendar has been preserved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
where the festivals in honour of this strange divinity
are indicated. The name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Divus</span></span> is given to him
on several coins; and, what is very odd, this Pagan
god is represented on the above-mentioned medals
holding in his hand the Christian sign of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">labarum</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We thus see that Constantine, instead of persecuting
the adherents of the national Paganism, was following
a policy of compromise between the two
characters united in his person, that of a Christian
and of a Roman emperor. This did not, however,
prevent him from heaping favours of every kind
upon the Christian church,—favours which proved
to her much more injurious than all the persecutions
of the former emperors. And, indeed, the
Christians, who had nobly stood the test of adversity,
were not proof against the more dangerous trial of a
sudden and unexpected prosperity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first favour granted by Constantine to the
Christians, and which he did even before his public
confession of their faith, was the extension to their
clergy of the exemption from various municipal
charges enjoyed by the Pagan priests, on account of
their being obliged to give at their expense certain
public games. The Christian clergy were thus placed
in a more favourable position than the Pagan priests,
because, though admitted to equal immunities, they
were not subjected to the same charges; and thus, for
the first time, a bribe was offered for conversion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to a religion which had hitherto generally exposed
its disciples to persecution. <span class="tei tei-q">“Numbers of people,
actuated less by conviction than by the hope of a
reward, were crowding from all parts to the churches,
and the first favour granted to the Christians introduced
amongst them guilty passions, to which they
had hitherto remained strangers, and whose action
was so rapid and so melancholy. The complaints of
the municipal bodies, and the disorder which it was
producing in the provincial administration, induced
Constantine to put some restrictions on a favour
which, being granted perhaps somewhat inconsiderately,
did more harm than good to the interests
of the Christian religion.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beugnot</span></span>, vol. i.,

Constantine increased his favours to the Christians
after he had publicly embraced their faith. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
ecclesiastical historians,”</span> says the author whom I
have just quoted, <span class="tei tei-q">“enumerate with a feeling of
pride the proofs of his generosity. They say, that
the revenues of the empire were employed to erect
everywhere magnificent churches, and to enrich the
bishops. They cannot be, on this occasion, accused
of exaggeration. Constantine introduced amongst
the Christians a taste for riches and luxury; and the
disappearance of their frugal and simple manners,
which had been the glory of the church during the
three preceding centuries, may be dated from his
reign.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ibid.</span></span>, p. 87.

The ecclesiastical historian Eusebius, a great admirer
of Constantine, whose personal friend he was,
admits himself, that the favours shown by that
monarch to the church have not been always conducive
to her purity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In short, the sudden triumph of the church
under Constantine was one of the principal causes
of her corruption, and the beginning of that compromise
with Paganism, described in the preceding
chapter. Paganism, though weakened through its
abandonment by the head of the state, was by no
means broken down at the time of Constantine's
death. Many of its zealous adherents were occupying
the principal dignities of the state, as well as the
most important civil and military offices; but its
chief stronghold was Rome, where its partisans were
so powerful, that the unfortunate dissensions which
divided the Christians were publicly exposed to
ridicule in the theatres of that city. The Arian
writer Philostorgus says that Constantine was worshipped
after his death, not as a saint, but as a god,
by the orthodox Christians, who offered sacrifices to
the statue of that monarch placed upon a column of
porphyry, and addressed prayers to him as to God
himself. It is impossible to ascertain whether examples
of such mad extravagance had ever taken
place amongst Christians or not; but the Western
church has not bestowed upon his memory the
honours of saintship, though she has been generally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
very lavish of them.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> Thus the first Christian emperor
was canonised only by the Pagans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sons of Constantine followed the religious
policy of their father; and the facility with which his
nephew, Julian the Apostate, had restored Paganism
to the rank of the dominant religion, twenty-four
years after his death, proves how strong its party was
even at that time. Julian's reign of eighteen months
was too short to produce any considerable effect
upon the religious parties into which the Roman
empire was then divided. After his death, the imperial
crown was offered by the army to Sallust,
a Pagan general, who having refused it on account of
his great age, it was bestowed upon Jovian, a Christian,
who reigned only three months. The legions
elected, after Jovian's death, Valentinian, who, though
a sincere Christian, strictly maintained the religious
liberty of his subjects; and the same policy was followed
by his brother and colleague Valens, who
governed the eastern part of the empire, and was
an Arian. Valentinian's son and successor, Gratian,
though educated by the celebrated poet Ausonius,
who adhered to the ancient worship, was a zealous
Christian. He published, immediately after his accession,
an edict allowing perfect religious liberty to
all his subjects, with the exception of the Manicheans
and some other sects. He granted several new privileges
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to Christians, but he continued to conform for
some time to the duties inherited from his Pagan
predecessors, of which the most remarkable instance
was, that he caused his father to be placed amongst
the gods, according to the general custom followed at
the death of the Roman emperors.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though greatly enfeebled by the continual advance
of Christianity, Paganism was still the established
religion of the state. Its rites were still
observed with their wonted solemnity, and its power
was still so great at Rome, that a vestal virgin was
executed in that city for the breach of her vow of
chastity, subsequently to the reign of Gratian. These
circumstances induced, probably, the above-mentioned
emperor to respect the religious institutions of
Rome during the first years of his reign, but (382),
acting under the advice of St Ambrose, he confiscated
the property belonging to the Pagan temples,
and the incomes of which served for the maintenance
of priests and the celebration of sacrifices.
He abolished, at the same time, all the privileges
and immunities of the Pagan priests, and ordered
the altar and statue of the goddess of Victory to
be removed from the hall of the senate, the presence
of which gave to that assembly, though it
already contained many Christian members, the character
of a Pagan institution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The senate sent a deputation to Gallia, where
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Gratian was at that time, in order to remonstrate
against these measures, and to present to him, at the
same time, the insignia of the supreme pontificate
of Rome, which none of his Christian predecessors
had yet refused. But Gratian rejected these emblems
of Paganism, saying that it was not meet for
a Christian to accept them. This would have been
probably followed by other more decided measures,
had he not perished a short time afterwards in a
rebellion. Theodosius the Great, whom Gratian had
associated with him, adopted a decidedly hostile
policy towards Paganism, and proclaimed a series
of laws against it. Thus, in 381, he ordered that
those Christians who returned to Paganism should
forfeit the right of making wills; but as these
apostasies continued, he ordered, in 383, that the
apostates should not inherit any kind of property,
either left by will or descended by natural order
of succession, unless it were left by their parents or
a brother. In 385 he proclaimed the penalty of
death against all those who should inquire into
futurity by consulting the entrails of the victims,
or try to obtain the same object by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">execrable</span></em> and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magic</span></em> consultations, which evidently referred to those
secret divinations that had been prohibited by Constantine,
as well as his Pagan predecessors. In the
course of the year 391, he published a series of edicts,
prohibiting under pain of death every immolation,
and all other acts of idolatry under that of confiscation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the houses or lands where they had been
performed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theodosius died in 395, but had his life been prolonged,
he would probably have developed still farther
his policy against Paganism, which was greatly
weakened in the course of his reign. Many Pagan
temples, particularly in the Eastern provinces, were
destroyed during his reign by the Christians, acting
without the orders of the emperor, but not punished
by him for these acts of violence. He did not, however,
constrain the Pagans to embrace Christianity;
and, notwithstanding that he proclaimed several
laws against their worship, he employed many of
them even in the highest offices of the state.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> Notwithstanding
the severe laws published by Theodosius
against idolatry, Rome still contained a great
number of pagan temples, and the polytheist party
continued to be strong in the senate, as well as in
the army, which is evident from the two following
facts. When Alaric elected in 409 Attalus emperor
of Rome, the new monarch distributed the
first dignities of the state to Pagans, and restored the
public solemnities of the ancient worship, in order
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to maintain himself on the throne by the support
of the Pagan party; which proves that, though a
century had already elapsed since the conversion
of Constantine, this party was not yet considered
quite insignificant. About the same time, Honorius
having proclaimed a law which excluded from the
offices of the imperial palace all those who did not
profess his religion, was obliged to revoke it, because
it gave offence to the Pagan officers of the army.
Arcadius, who succeeded Theodosius on the throne
of the Eastern empire, proclaimed, immediately after
his accession in 398, that he would strictly enforce
the laws of his father against Paganism, and he
issued in the following year new and more severe
ordinances of the same kind. The blow which
may be said to have overturned Paganism in the
Roman empire did not, however, come from its
Christian monarchs, but from the same hand which
destroyed its ancient capital, and inflicted upon the
Western empire a mortal wound which it did not
survive many years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Goths, whom the energy and wise policy of
Theodosius had maintained in their allegiance to the
empire, being offended by Arcadius, revolted, and
invaded his dominions under Alaric, in 396. They
ravaged the provinces situated between the Adriatic
and the Black Seas, and penetrated into Greece,
where Paganism, notwithstanding all the enactments
of Theodosius, was still prevailing to a very great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
extent. The principal cities of Greece were devastated
by the Goths, who, recently converted to
Arianism, and having no taste for arts, destroyed all
the temples, statues, and other pagan monuments,
with which they met. Athens escaped the fury of the
invaders, but the celebrated temple of Eleusis, whose
mysteries continued in full vigour in spite of all the
laws which had been published against polytheism,
was destroyed, whilst its priests either perished or
fled. This catastrophe was so much felt by the adherents
of the ancient worship in Greece, that many of
them are said to have committed suicide from grief.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Since the defeat of Cheronea, and the capture of
Corinth, the Greek nationality had never experienced
a severer blow than the destruction of its
temples and of its gods by Alaric,”</span> says an eminent
German writer of our day.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> It was, indeed, a mortal
blow to a religion which maintained its sway by
acting upon the senses and the imagination, as well
as upon the feelings of national pride or vanity, because
it destroyed all the means by which such feelings
were produced. Alaric and his Goths seem
to have been destined by Providence to precipitate
the fall of Paganism at Rome, as well as in Greece,
because the capture and sack of the eternal city by
these barbarians, in 410, accelerated the ruin of its
ancient worship more than all the laws proclaimed
against it by the Christian emperors. The particulars
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of this terrible catastrophe have been amply
described by Gibbon, and I shall only observe, that
though Christians had suffered on that occasion as
much as Pagans, the worship of the latter was
struck at the very root of its existence by the complete
ruin of the Roman aristocracy, who, although
frequently indifferent about the tenets of the national
polytheism, supported it with all their influence as a
political institution, which could not be abolished
without injuring the most vital interests of their
order.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> The decline of Paganism from that time
was very rapid. It is true that we have sufficient
historical evidence to show that pagan temples
were still to be found at Rome after its sack by
the Goths, and that many Pagans were employed,
in the Western as well as in the Eastern empires,
in some of the most important offices of the state;
but their number was fast disappearing, and the
exercise of their religion was generally confined to
the domestic hearth, to the worship of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lares</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Penates</span></span>. It seems to have been particularly
prevalent amongst the rustic population of the provinces,
and it was not entirely extinct in Italy
even at the beginning of the sixth century; because
the Goth, Theodoric the Great, who reigned over
that country from 493 to 526, published an edict
forbidding, under pain of death, to sacrifice according
to the Pagan rites, as well as other superstitious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
practices remaining from the ancient polytheism.

I have given this sketch of the state of Paganism
after the conversion of Constantine, and of the policy
which was followed towards it by the first Christian
emperors, because it seems to explain, at least to a
certain degree, the manner in which Christianity was

the Pagan ideas and practices which I shall endeavour

I have said that the council of Elvira, in Spain, held
in 305, prohibited the use of images in the churches.

then Christians were but too prone to relapse into

enact very severe ecclesiastical penances against those
Christians who took part in the rites and festivals
of the Pagan worship.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>

If such enactments were required to maintain the
purity of Christian doctrine, at a time when its converts,
instead of expecting any worldly advantages,
were often exposed to severe persecution, and consequently
had no other motives for embracing it than a
mere conviction of its truth, how much more was this
purity endangered when conversion to Christianity led
to the favour of the sovereign, and when the church,
instead of severely repressing the idolatrous propensities
of her children, endeavoured to facilitate as much
as possible the entrance of the Pagans into her pale!
Let me add, that the mixture of Christianity with
Paganism in various public acts of the first Christian
emperors, which I have described in the preceding
chapter, could not but contribute to the general confusion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of ideas amongst those Christians whom the
church was continually receiving into her pale, with
all their pagan notions. I have described, in the second
chapter of this essay, the policy of compromise
adopted by the church after the conversion of Constantine.
I shall now describe the consequences
of this policy, by giving a sketch of the Christian
society which it produced, and which has been
drawn, on the authority of ecclesiastical writers, by
the same author whose description and defence of
that policy I have given in the above-mentioned
chapter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Towards the beginning of the fifth century, the
propagation of Christianity amongst the upper
classes of Roman society met still with many obstacles;
but the influential persons who had broken
with the error, remained at least faithful to their
new creed, and did not scandalise society by their
apostasy. The senatorial families which had embraced
Christianity gave, at Rome, the unfortunately
too rare example of piety and of all the Christian
virtues; the case was different with the converts
belonging to the lower, and even the middle classes
of Roman society. The corruption of manners had
made rapid progress amongst them during the last
fifty years of the fourth century; and things arrived
at such a pass, that the choice of a religion was
considered by the people as an act of the greatest
indifference. The new religion was embraced from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
interest, from curiosity, or by fashion, and afterwards
abandoned on the first occasion. It was, in
fact, not indifference, because indifference induces
people to remain in the religion in which they were
born; it was a complete atheism, a revolting depravity,
an openly-expressed contempt of all that is
most sacred. How many times the church, which
struggled, but in vain, against the progress of the
evil, had occasion to lament the too easy recruits
whom she was making amongst the inferior ranks of
society!<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> People disgracefully ignorant, without
honour, without a shadow of piety, polluted by their
presence the assemblies of the faithful. They are
those whom the fathers of the church designated by
the name of the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mali Christiani</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ficti
Christiani</span></span>,
and against whom their eloquent voices were often
resounding. The heretics, the promoters of troubles
and seditions, always counted upon those men, who
seemed to enter the church only in order to disturb
her by their turbulent spirit, or who consented to remain
in the true faith only on condition of introducing
into the usages of Christian worship, a crowd of superstitions whose influence
was felt but too long;<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>

applied the before-mentioned dispositions to those
Christians who became Jews or Manicheans. We
know, from a law of 391, that the nobility was infected
by the general spirit of the age, because Valentinian
enacted, by this law, that those nobles
who became apostates were to be degraded in
such a manner that they should not count even <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in

again of the right to make wills those Christians

The political authorities, therefore, cannot be accused
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of having remained indifferent to the progress of
the evil. We must now show how little power
the laws had in a time like that which we are describing.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One day, St Augustinus presented to the assembly
of the Christians of Hippona, a man who was to become
celebrated amongst renegades; born a Pagan,
he embraced Christianity, but returned again to the
idols, and exercised the lucrative profession of an astrologer;
he now demanded to be readmitted into the
church, that is to say, to change for the third time
his religion. St Augustinus addressed, on that occasion,
the above-mentioned assembly in the following
manner:—</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘This former Christian, terrified by the power of
God, is now repenting. In the days of his faithfulness,
he was enticed by the enemy, and became an
astrologer; seduced and deceived himself, he was
seducing and deceiving others; he uttered many
lies against God, who gave men the power to
do good, and to do no evil; he said that it was
not the will of men which made men adulterers,
but Venus; that it was Mars who rendered people
murderers; that justice was not inspired by God,
but by Jupiter; and he added to it many other
sacrileges. How much money he has swindled from
self-styled Christians! How many people have
purchased the lie from him! But now, if we are to
believe him, he hates the error, he laments the loss
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of many souls; and feeling himself caught by the
demon, he returns toward God full of repentance.
Let us believe, brethren, that it is fear which produces
this change. What shall we say? perhaps
we must not rejoice so much at the conversion of
this pagan astrologer, because once being converted,
he may seek to obtain the clerical office; he
is penitent, brethren, and asks only for mercy. I
recommend him to your hearts, and to your eyes.
Let your hearts love him, but let your eyes watch
him. Mark him well; and wherever you shall meet
him, show him to those of your brethren who are
not present here. This will be an act of mercy, because
we must fear that his seductive soul should
change again, and recommence to do mischief.
Watch him; know what he says, and where he
goes, in order that your testimony may confirm us
in the opinion that he is really converted. He was
perishing, but now he is found again. He has
brought with him the books which have burnt him,
in order to throw them into the fire; he wishes to
be refreshed by the flames which shall consume
them. You must know, brethren, that he had
knocked at the door of the church before Easter, but
that the profession which he had followed, rendering
him suspected of lies and fraud, he was kept back,
but shortly afterwards received. We are afraid of
leaving him exposed to new temptations. Pray to
Christ for him.’</span></span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Socrates<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> speaks of a sophist of Constantinople,
called Ecebolus, who conformed with a marvellous
facility to all the changes of fortune which Christianity
was undergoing. During the reign of Constantine,
he affected the greatest zeal for the new
belief; but when Julian became emperor, he resumed
his ancient devotion to the gods of Paganism.
After the death of that monarch, he gave great
publicity to his repentance, and prostrated himself
before the churches, crying to the Christians,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Tread me under your feet, as the salt which has
lost its savour!’</span> Socrates adds:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Ecebolus remained
what he has always been,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a fickle and
inconstant man.’</span> St Augustinus could certainly say
the same of his astrologer. Is it not surprising to
find apostasy still prevalent at a time when no sensible
man could believe in the restoration of the
ancient worship? The appearance of Julian must
have upset many a mind, shaken many a conscience,
and given to the triumph of Christianity the character
of a transitory event. But, at the end of the
fourth century, it was impossible to abandon the
church and return to the idols, except by a feeling
which could not but excite profound pity. I
therefore understand why St Augustinus had consented
to plead with the Christians in favour of a
wretch already charged with three apostasies: he
wished, above all, to take from him the name of a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pagan, being convinced that whoever consented no
longer to sacrifice to the false gods would finally
belong to the true religion. A neophyte, restrained
by the leaven of all the pagan passions, might remain
more or less time on the threshold of the church, but sooner
or later he was sure to cross it.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>
The leaders of the church considered it always a
favourable presumption when a citizen consented to
call himself no longer a Pagan. This first victory
appeared to them a sure presage of a true conversion;
and they recommended to the Christians that
they should not apply the dangerous epithet of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pagan</span></em> to those of their brethren who had failed, but
simply to call them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sinners</span></em>. They endeavoured, in
short, to make them forget Paganism; and in order
to attain this object, they even forbade to pronounce
its name.</span><a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The ancient worship was not only obstructing
the development of Christianity by covert and insidious
attacks, but it was also vitiating the discipline
of the church, because its sway upon the manners of
the converts was something more like a real tyranny
than the natural remnant of its former influence. It
is, indeed, surprising with what facility it introduced
into the sanctuary of the true God its superstitious
spirit, its relaxed morals, and its love of disorder.
How little the church was then,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, seventy years
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after the conversion of Constantine,—resembling
what she ought to have been, or what she became
afterwards!<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> St Jerome had intended, towards the
end of his life, to write an ecclesiastical history; but
it was in order to show that the church, under the
Christian emperors, went on continually declining.
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Divitiis major, virtutibus minor</span></span> (Greater in
wealth, smaller in virtue), was the severe sentence which
St Jerome must have pronounced with regret, but
the justice of which is proved by all the historical
documents of that period. This illustrious leader of
Christianity, whose mind was more inclined to enthusiasm
than dejection, frequently lost all energy,
by reflecting on the deplorable condition of the
church, declaring that he felt no longer any power
to write. A sufficient number of historians have
represented in vivid colours the excessive luxury of
the bishops during that time, as well as the greediness,
the ignorance, and the misconduct of the
clergy; I shall therefore choose from this melancholy
picture only those parts which refer to the
history of Paganism.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“All the arts of divination remained still in the
highest favour amongst Christians, even when the
grave men of the Pagan party had been, for a long
time, showing for these practices of idolatry either a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conventional respect or an open contempt.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> They
swore by the false gods,—they observed the fifth
day, dedicated to Jupiter,—and they took a part in
the sacred games, feasts, and festivals of the Pagans.
Christian ceremonies did not preserve almost any
thing of their ancient majesty. It was not a rare
occurrence to hear pagan hymns chanted at Christian
solemnities, or to see Christians dancing before
their churches, according to the custom of Paganism.
There was no more decency observed in the interior
of those churches: people went there to speak about
business, or to amuse themselves; the noise was so
great, and the bursts of laughter so loud, that it was
impossible to hear the reading of the Scriptures; the
congregation quarrelled, fought, and sometimes interfered
with the officiating priest, pressing him to end,
or compelling him to sing, according to their taste.
St Augustinus was therefore warranted in calling
this so powerful influence of the ancient worship a
persecution of the demon, more covert and insidious
than that which the primitive church had suffered.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“All these scandalous facts are attested by the
bishop of Hippona (St Augustinus) and by that of
Milan (St Ambrose); it is therefore impossible to
doubt their authenticity. It may, however, be said,
that such a state of corruption was local, and peculiar
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the churches of Africa and Milan; I must
therefore produce new evidence, in order to show
that the calamitous effect of the pagan manners was
felt in all the provinces.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“St Gaudentius, bishop of Brescia, a contemporary
of St Augustinus, vigorously combated idolatry
in his diocese; and the following is an extract from
one of his sermons:—</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘You neophytes, who have been called to the
feast of this salutary and mystical Easter, look how
you preserve your souls from those aliments which
have been defiled by the superstition of the Pagans.
It is not enough for a true Christian to reject the
poisoned food of the demons; he must also fly from
all the abominations of the Pagans,—from all the
frauds of the idolaters, as from venom ejected by
the serpent of the devil. Idolatry is composed of
poisonings, of enchantments, ligatures, presages, augurs,
sorceries, as well as of all kinds of vain observances,
and, moreover, of the festival called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parentales</span></span>;
by means of which idolatry is reanimating
error; and indeed men, giving way to their gluttony,
began to eat the viands which had been prepared for
the dead; afterwards they were not afraid of celebrating
in their honour sacrilegious sacrifices,—although
it is difficult to believe that a duty towards
their dead is discharged by those who, with a hand
shaking from the effects of drunkenness, place tables
on sepulchres, and say, with an unintelligible voice,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who may wonder that such Christians allowed
the pagan idols, temples, and altars to remain, and
to be honoured on their estates, as is attested by
the same bishop? St Augustinus, whom I am not
tired of quoting, because no other doctor of that time
expressed so vividly the true Christian ideas, lamented
this monstrous worship, which was neither Paganism
nor Christianity. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Many a man,’</span> says he,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘who enters the church a Christian, leaves it a
Pagan,’</span> However, far from despairing, he wrote to
the virgin Felicia, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I advise thee not to be affected
too much by these offences; they were predicted, in
order that, when they should come, we might remember
that they had been announced, and consequently
not be hurt by them.’</span> But the Pagans, for whom
this premature corruption of Christianity was not a
predicted thing, rejoiced in contemplating the extent
of its progress; they would not believe the duration
of a worship which had so rapidly arrived at the
period of its decline, and they were repeating in their
delusion this celebrated saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Christians are only
for awhile; they will afterwards perish, and the idols
will return.’</span> ”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beugnot</span></span>, vol. ii. p.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This melancholy picture of Christian society, at
the beginning of the fifth century, drawn by M.
Beugnot, on the authority of the ecclesiastical writers,
is, indeed, as gloomy as that of Roman society in
general, which had been so graphically described
about the same time by the pagan author Ammianus
Marcellinus, and reproduced by Gibbon. It was
very natural that such a corrupted soil should produce
the rankest growth of superstition, and rapidly
bring about that melancholy reaction which was not
inaptly styled by Gibbon, <span class="tei tei-q">“the revival of polytheism
in the Christian church.”</span> This wretched state of
things was, as I have said before, chiefly due to that
policy of compromise by which the leaders of the
church sought to get as many Pagans as possible
into her pale, and who consequently were baptised
without being converted. This compromise with
Paganism was often carried to great extremes; and
the history of the conversion of Florence, which I
have extracted from M. Beugnot's work, gives one
of the most striking instances of those unprincipled
proceedings:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Florence paid particular honours to
the god Mars. It was not without regret that it
abandoned the worship of this divinity. The time
of its conversion had been assigned to the second or
the third century, but the vagueness of this date
deprives it of all authority. Yet, whatever may have
been the century in which the conversion of Florence
took place, it could not be a subject of edification
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and joy to the Christians. The traditions of that city
predicted to it great calamities if the statue of Mars
was either sullied, or put into a place unworthy of
it. The Florentines stipulated, therefore, on accepting
the new religion, that Mars should be respected.
His statue was consequently neither broken nor
sullied, but it was carefully taken from his temple,
and placed on a pedestal near the river, which flows
through the city. Many years after this, the new
Christians feared and invoked that god who was dethroned
only by halves. When almost all the pagan
temples had fallen either by the stroke of time, or
under the blows of the Christians, the heathen palladium
of Florence stood still erect on the banks of
the Arno; and, according to one of the most enlightened
historians that Italy has produced during
the middle ages (G. Villani, lib. i., cap. 60), the
demon who had remained in the statue realised, in
the thirteenth century, the old prediction of the
Etruscans.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> Compromises of the kind which took
place at Florence became very common during the
fifth century, and when, at a later period, Christianity
wished to annul them, it met with great
obstacles.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Beugnot</span></span>,
vol. i., p. 286.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Jews had been brought up in the knowledge
of the true God, and their faith could not but be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
strengthened by the miracles with which their exodus
from Egypt was accompanied, and yet a short absence
of Moses from their camp was sufficient to make
them call for gods that would go before them, and
to induce them to worship an image evidently borrowed
from the idolatry of those very Egyptians by
whom they had been so much oppressed. It was,
therefore, no wonder that society, educated for many
centuries under the influence of Paganism, were
continually returning to their ancient rites, superstitions,
and manners, though under a new name,
and in a modified form. If we consider further, that
such a man as Aaron had not sufficient strength to
resist the senseless demands of the multitude, and
even consented to mould an object for their idolatry,
how could the leaders of the church oppose
the pressure of Paganism, which they had incautiously
admitted into her pale, and which, under
the assumed name of Christianity, was establishing
its dominion over the church? There was no inspired
prophet amongst the Christians of that time,
to restore the purity of their faith in the same manner
as Moses did amongst the Jews, after his return
from Mount Sinai. The Christian church was
therefore left for centuries under the oppression of
pagan superstitions, from which, as yet, only a small
portion of her has been emancipated, though I firmly
believe that she will be one day entirely restored
to her pristine purity. This hope, however, is not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
founded upon the mere advance of human intellect,
because, in spite of its boasted progress, it seems now
to be powerless against the daily growing reaction of
the above-mentioned superstitions, even in places
whence they apparently had been banished for ever,
but because Christianity is of a divine and not human
origin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was no lack of opposition to this universal
corruption of the church on the part of several
true Christians, and there were undoubtedly many
more instances of this noble conduct than those
which have reached us, but the records of them were
probably either lost in the lapse of ages, or destroyed
by their opponents. I have already mentioned the
prohibition of the use of images in the churches by
the council of Elvira in 305. The council of Laodicea,
held about 363, declared, in its seventy-fifth
canon, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That Christians ought not to abandon the
church, and retire elsewhere in order to invoke angels,
and form private assemblies, because it is prohibited.
If, therefore, any one is attached to this
secret idolatry, let him be anathema, because he has
left our Lord Jesus Christ, and has become an idolater.</span></em>”</span>
It is therefore evident that this superstition,
expressly prohibited by St Paul, Col. ii. 18, was then
secretly practised in some private assemblies, though
it was afterwards introduced into the Western as well
as the Eastern church. The council of Carthage, held
towards the end of the fourth century, condemned the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abuse of the honours which were paid to the memory
of the martyrs by the Christians of Africa, and ordered
the bishops to repress them, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if the thing might be
done, but if it could not be done on account of the
popular emotions</span></em>, to warn at least the people. This
proves how weak the bishops felt their authority
to be against the prevailing superstitions amongst
their flocks, and that they preferred suffering the latter
to risking the former.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were, however, Christians who opposed, in a
bold and uncompromising manner, the pagan errors
and abuses which had infected the church. St Epiphanius,
archbishop of Salamis, in the fourth century,
celebrated for his learning, and whose virtues
St Jerome extols in the most glowing terms, explicitly
condemned the worship of created beings, <span class="tei tei-q">“because,”</span>
he observed, <span class="tei tei-q">“the devil was creeping into
men's minds under the pretence of devotion and
justice, and, consecrating human nature by divine
honours, presented to their eyes various fine images,
in order to separate the mind from the one God by
an infamous adultery. Therefore, though those who
are worshipped are dead, people adore their images,
which never had any life in them.”</span> He further remarked,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that there was not a prophet who would
have suffered a man or a woman to be worshipped;
that neither the prophet Elias, nor St John
the beloved disciple of the Lord, nor St Thecla
(who had received the most extravagant praises from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the fathers), were ever worshipped; and that, consequently,
the virgin was neither to be invoked nor
worshipped.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The old superstition</span></em>,”</span> says he,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shall not have such power over us as to oblige us to
abandon the living God, and worship his creature.</span></em>”</span><a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same St Epiphanius relates, in a letter addressed
to John, bishop of Jerusalem, that having
arrived during a journey at a village called Anablatta,
he found in its church a veil suspended over
the door, with a figure representing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christ or some
saint</span></em>. He was so indignant at this sight that he
immediately tore the veil to pieces, and advised the
wardens of that church to employ it as a shroud to bury
a dead body. As the people of the place complained
that the veil of their church was destroyed, without
giving them in its place another, Epiphanius sent
them one; but he exhorted in his letter the above-mentioned
bishop of Jerusalem, in whose diocese
Anablatta was situated, to order the priests of that
place not to suspend any more such veils in the
church of Christ, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because they are contrary to our
religion</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The authenticity of this letter, which bears such
strong evidence against the use of images in churches,
was rejected by Bellarmine and the ecclesiastical
historian Baronius, but it has been admitted by Petau
and some of the ablest writers of the Roman Catholic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Church. It was translated into Latin by St Jerome,
and is found in all the collections of his works.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most celebrated opponent of the abuses with
which the church had been already infected at that
time was Vigilantius. His writings have not been preserved,
and we know his opinions only from their refutation
by St Jerome, and from which we may conclude
that this reformer of the fifth century maintained
the same doctrines which were afterwards
defended by the Waldensians, Wycliffe, the Hussites,
and which are now professed by the Protestant Christians.
He was born at Calagorris in Gallia; he became
a priest at Barcelona, and contracted in that
place an intimate friendship with St Paulinus, afterwards
bishop of Nola. Vigilantius went to Italy in
order to see this friend of his, and having an intention
to visit Palestine and Egypt, took from him an
introduction to St Jerome. They became great
friends with St Jerome, who was much pleased with
the marks of approbation shown by Vigilantius
during a sermon which he preached. He also
acknowledges that he, as well as several others,
would have died from starvation, if Vigilantius
had not assisted them with his own and his friends'
money; and he says, in his answer to Paulinus,
<span class="tei tei-q">“You will learn from the mouth of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the holy priest,
Vigilantius</span></em>, with what affection I have received
him.”</span> This affection disappeared, however, as soon
as Jerome learned that Vigilantius had accused him in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Egypt of being too partial to Origenes, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holy
priest</span></em> became an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impertinent</span></em>, whose silly speeches
he had observed during their first interview. He
made use of several injurious expressions in speaking
of the former object of his admiration, and which do
not well accord with the gravity of his character, as,
for instance, calling him often <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dormitantius</span></span> instead
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vigilantius</span></span>. His indignation knew no bounds when
he heard, in 404, that Vigilantius, who was then in
Gallia, had attacked several practices which had crept
into the church, and he dictated in one single night
a vehement answer to the opinions of Vigilantius,
who, according to this writer, taught as follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the honours paid to the rotten bones and
dust of the saints and martyrs, by adoring, kissing,
wrapping them in silver, and enclosing them in vessels
of gold, placing them in churches, and lighting
wax candles before them, was idolatry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the celibacy of the clergy was heresy, and
their vows of chastity a seminary of lewdness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That to pray for the dead, or desire their prayers,
was superstition, and that we can pray one for another
only as long as we are alive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the souls of the departed apostles and martyrs
were at rest in some particular place, and could
not leave it, in order to be present in various places,
for hearing the prayers addressed to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the sepulchres of the martyrs should not be
venerated; that vigils held in churches should be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abolished, with the exception of that at Easter; that
to enter monastic life was to become useless to society,
&amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The answer of Jerome to the above-mentioned
opinions of Vigilantius is a curious mixture of violence
and casuistry. He declared his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quondam</span></span>
friend and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holy priest</span></em>, Vigilantius, a greater monster
than all those which nature had ever produced,
the Centaurs, the Behemoths, the Syrens,
the triple-bodied Gerion of Spain; that he was a
most detestable heretic, venting foul blasphemies
against the relics of the martyrs, who were working
miracles everyday. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go,”</span> says he to Vigilantius, <span class="tei tei-q">“into
the churches of those martyrs, and thou shalt be
cleansed from the evil spirit by which thou art now
possessed, and feel thyself burning, not by those wax
candles which offend thee, but by invisible flames,
which will force that demon who talks within thee
to confess that he is the same as that who had personated,
perhaps a Mercury, a Bacchus, or some
other of the heathen gods, amongst their followers,”</span>
&amp;c. He is unable, however, to produce any other
argument in support of the worship of relics than the
example of those who had practised it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Was it
wrong,”</span> he exclaims, <span class="tei tei-q">“of the bishops of Rome to
celebrate divine service on the graves containing the
bones of St Peter and St Paul, which, according to
Vigilantius, were nothing better than dust? The
Emperor Constantius must then have committed a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sacrilege by translating the holy relics of Andrew,
Luke, and Timothy, to Constantinople; the Emperor
Arcadius must be then also considered sacrilegious,
as he has translated the bones of the blessed Samuel
from Judea to Thrace; then all those bishops who
consented to preserve mere dust in vessels of gold
or wrapt in silk, were not only sacrilegious, but were
fools; and, finally, that all these people must have
been fools who went out to meet these relics, and
received them with as much joy as if they were the
prophet himself alive, because the procession which
carried them was attended by crowds of people from
Palestine to Chalcedon, singing the praises of Christ,
whose servant Samuel was.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no abuse in the world which cannot be
justified, if the example of persons occupying a high
station or that of great numbers is sufficient for it.
The advocates of the adoration of relics in our own
days may defend it by the fact that about half a
million of people went in 1845 to worship the holy
coat of Treves, and that still more recently great
honours were paid to the relics of St Theodosia at
Amiens, by a number of distinguished persons,—bishops,
archbishops, and even cardinals. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">autos
da fé</span></span> of the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions
could not be wrong, since kings, queens, and the most
eminent persons of the state, approved them by their
presence. Idolatry cannot be an error, since so
many monarchs, statesmen, and learned men, had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conformed to its rites; whilst, on the other side, the
same reason may be pleaded for the penal laws of
Ireland, and other enactments against the Roman
Catholics, because they were established and maintained
by so many parliaments. Jerome maintained
that it was a calumny of Vigilantius to say that the
Christians burnt candles in daylight, though he admitted
that it was done by some men and women in
order to honour the martyrs. He did not approve
of it, because their zeal was without knowledge; but
he thought that on account of their good intention,
they would be rewarded according to their faith,
like the woman who had anointed the feet of our
Lord. He also tried to justify the use of candles by
those passages of the Scriptures where an allusion
was made to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lamps and lights</span></em>; as, for instance, the
parable of the virgins, the expression of the Psalm
cxix. 105, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and
a light unto my path.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rest of the arguments which St Jerome employs
in refuting what he calls the errors and
heresies of Vigilantius are of a similar nature to
those which have been given above; and it is really
astonishing to see that a man like this celebrated
father, who is generally considered as one of the
great luminaries of the church, not only by Roman
Catholics, but also by some Protestants, could descend
to such miserable shifts, and indulge in such
violent language as he did, in his answer to Vigilantius,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which bears a strong mark of having been
dictated more by his personal feelings against his
former friend and benefactor, than by a conviction of
the justice of the cause which he was defending on
that occasion. It is, however, evident from the
other writings of the same father of the church,
that his imagination was much more powerful than
his reasoning faculties, and that he had entirely forgotten
the precept of St Paul, to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">refuse profane
and old wives' fables</span></em>”</span>—(1 Timothy iv. 7)—because
no one has ever indulged in more absurd fables than
this good father did, in his lives of St Hilarion and
St Paul, two celebrated monks, and of which the
following is a fair specimen:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A Christian citizen of Majuma, called Italicus,
kept horses for racing, but was continually beaten by
his rival, a pagan ducumvir of Gaza, who, by using
certain charms and diabolical incantations, contrived
always to damp the spirits of the Christian's horses,
and to give vigour to his own. Italicus applied,
therefore, for help to St Hilarion, who, thinking that
it was improper to make prayers for such a frivolous
object, advised Italicus to sell his horses, and to give
their price to the poor, for the salvation of his soul.
Italicus represented, however, that he was discharging
against his inclination the duties of a public office,
and that as a Christian could not resort to magical
means, he addressed himself to a servant of God, particularly
as it was important to defeat the inhabitants
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Gaza, who were known as enemies of Christ, and
that it was not so much for his own interests as
for those of the church that he wished to overcome
his rival. Hilarion, convinced by these reasons, filled
with water an earthen vessel, from which he usually
drank, and delivered it to Italicus, who sprinkled
with the water his horses, his chariots and charioteers,
his stables, and even the barriers of the racing ground.
The whole city was in a great excitement, the idolaters
deriding the Christians, who loudly expressed
their confidence of victory. The signal being given,
the Christian's horses flew with an extreme rapidity,
and left those of his rival far behind. This miracle
produced a very great effect upon the spectators, and
many persons, including the beaten party, became
converts to Christianity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The above-mentioned work is filled with fables
still more extravagant than the one which I have related,
and which entirely throw into the shade the
celebrated tales of Munchausen. Jerome complained
that many people, whom, in his Christian meekness,
he calls <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scyllean dogs</span></span>, were laughing at the stories
related in those works, and which he begins by invoking
the assistance of the Holy Ghost. Was it
then a wonder that a Christianity, defended by such
wretched superstitions, was frequently abandoned by
individuals, who, comparing the Christian legends of
the kind quoted above with the fictions of Pagan
mythology, preferred the latter as being more poetical?
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and, indeed, we have instances of the ridicule
which the Pagans attempted to throw upon Christianity,
by comparing its saints with their own gods
and demigods.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I must, however, return once more to Vigilantius.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>
The Roman Catholic historian of the church, Baronius,
who calls him <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a horned beast, a fool, and
furious, who had reached the last degree of folly and
fury</span></em>,”</span> &amp;c., &amp;c., maintains that his heresy was solemnly
condemned by the Pope Innocent I., whom the
bishops of Gallia had addressed on this subject. He
also says that the same heresy produced terrible consequences;
because two years after Vigilantius had
spread his doctrines, the Vandals and other barbarians
invaded Gallia, and destroyed all his adherents. Admitting
even with Baronius that Vigilantius was a
damnable heretic, it cannot be denied that this
learned historian had a very strange notion of divine
justice, because the barbarians alluded to above
destroyed a great number of churches and relics, as
well as those who prayed at their shrines, whilst
Vigilantius died quietly, and, notwithstanding the
assertion of Baronius, never was excluded from the
communion of the church, or even condemned by
her legal authorities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We know from Vigilantius' opponents that his
opinions were approved by many, and there can be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no doubt that there was, not only in his days, but
long after him, a good number of witnesses for the
truth, who opposed the rapid spread of Pagan ideas
and practices in the church. Thus, at the end of
the sixth century, Serenus, bishop of Marseilles, removed
all the images from his church, because the
people worshipped them. This produced a great
discontent amongst many people of his diocese, who
appealed to Pope Gregory I. in favour of the images.
The Pope advised a middle course, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, that the
images should remain in the church, but that it
should not be allowed to worship them. Serenus,
however, who well knew that the one infallibly led
to the other, refused to comply with the papal injunctions,
upon which Gregory wrote to him again,
saying that he praised his zeal in not suffering the
worship of any thing that was made by the hand of
man; but that images should not be destroyed, because
pictures were used in churches to teach the
ignorant by sight what they could not read in books,
&amp;c.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We therefore see that at the end of the sixth
century, the celebrated Pope Gregory I., surnamed
the Great, considered the worship of images as an
abuse to be prohibited, but which was afterwards legalised
by his successors, and an opposition to it declared
heresy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I could produce other evidences to show that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worship of images was condemned by many bishops
and priests of the period which I have described,
though they approved their use as a means of teaching
the illiterate, or tolerated them as an unavoidable
evil. The limits of this essay allow me not,
however, to extend my researches on this subject,
and I shall endeavour to give in the next chapter a
rapid sketch of the violent reaction against the worship
of images in the east by the iconoclast emperors,
and of the more moderate, but no less decided,
opposition to the same practice in the west by
Charlemagne.

Other Superstitious Practices By The Iconoclast
Emperors Of The East.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worship of images, as well as other Pagan
practices, introduced into the church during the
fourth and fifth centuries, were prevailing in the
east as much as in the west; and I have mentioned,
p. <a href="#Pg009" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>, that the monks, particularly those of Egypt,
had greatly contributed to the introduction of anthropomorphism
into the Christian church. A great
blow to image-worship was given in the east by the
rise and rapid progress of Mahometanism, whose followers,
considering it as idolatry, destroyed many
objects to which certain miraculous virtues had
been ascribed, and they constantly taunted the
Christians with their belief in such superstitions.
The Jews addressed the same reproaches to the
Christians; <span class="tei tei-q">“yet,”</span> as Gibbon has justly observed,
<span class="tei tei-q">“their servitude might curb their zeal and depreciate
their authority; but the triumphant Mussulman,
who reigned at Damascus, and threatened Constantinople,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cast into the scale of reproach the accumulated
weight of truth and victory.”</span><a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> And, indeed,
there could not be a stronger argument against
the efficacy of images than the rapid conquest by
the Mahometans of many Christian cities which relied
upon a miraculous defence by some images preserved
in their churches. This circumstance could
not but produce, in the minds of many thinking
Christians, a conviction of the absurdity of image-worship,
and the spread of such opinions must have
been promoted by congregations who had preserved
the purity of primitive worship, and of whom it
appears that there were several still extant in the
eighth century, as well as by the influence of Armenia,
a country with which the eastern empire had frequent
intercourse of a political and commercial nature,
and whose church rejected at that time the
worship of images. This party wanted only a leader
and favourable circumstances in order publicly to
assert their condemnation of the prevailing practice,
which they considered as sinful idolatry. The accession
of Leo III., the Isaurian, in 717, who, from
an inferior condition, rose by his talents and military
prowess to the imperial throne, gave to that party
what they required, for he shared their opinions,
and was a man of great energy and ability. The
troubles of the state, which the valour and political
wisdom of Leo saved from impending ruin, occupied
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
too much the first years of that emperor's reign
to allow him to undertake a reform of the church.
But in 727 he assembled a council of senators and
bishops, and decided, with their consent, that all the
images should be removed in the churches from the
sanctuary and the altar, to a height where they might
be seen, but not worshipped, by the congregation.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a>
It was, however, impossible to follow long this middle
course, as the adherents of the images contrived
to worship them in spite of their elevation, while their
opponents taxed the emperor with want of zeal, holding
out to him the example of the Jewish monarch,
who had caused the brazen serpent to be broken.
Leo therefore ordered all kinds of images to be destroyed;
and though his edict met with some opposition,<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>
it was put into execution throughout the
whole empire, with the exception of the Italian provinces,
which, instigated by Pope Gregory II., a
zealous defender of images, revolted against the
emperor, and resisted all his efforts to regain his
dominion over them. This monarch died in 741,
after a not inglorious reign of twenty-four years, and
was succeeded on the throne by his son Constantine
VIII., surnamed Copronymus. All the information
which we possess about this monarch, as well as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the other iconoclast emperors, is derived from historians
violently opposed to their religious views.
These writers represent Constantine VIII. as one
of the greatest monsters that ever disgraced humanity,
stained by every imaginable vice; and having
exhausted all the usual terms of opprobrium,
they invent some such ridiculous expressions as a
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leopard generated by a lion, an aspic born from
the seeds of a serpent, a flying dragon</span></em>,”</span> &amp;c.; but
they do not adduce in confirmation of these epithets
any of those criminal acts which have disgraced the
reigns of many Byzantine emperors, whose piety is
extolled by the same writers. We know, moreover,
by the evidence of those very historians who have
bespattered with all those opprobrious terms the
memory of Constantine, that he was a brave and
skilful leader, who defeated the Arabs, the most
formidable enemies of the empire, and restored
several of its lost provinces, and that the country
was prosperous under his reign of thirty-four years—741
to 775.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The beginning of Constantine's reign was disturbed
by his own brother-in-law, Artabasdes, who,
supported by the adherents of the images, competed
for the imperial throne, but was defeated, and his
party crushed. Constantine, desiring to abolish the
abuse, which he regarded as idolatry, by a solemn
decision of the church declared, in 753, his intention
to convoke for this object a general council;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and in order that the question at issue should be
thoroughly sifted, he enjoined all the bishops of the
empire to assemble local synods, and to examine
the subject, previously to its being debated by the
general council. This council, composed of three
hundred and thirty-eight bishops, met at Constantinople
in 754, and, after having deliberated for
six months, decided that, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conformably to Holy
Writ and the testimony of the fathers, all images
were to be removed from the churches, and whoever
would dare to make an image, in order
to place it in a church, to worship it, or to keep
it concealed in his house, was, if a clerk, to be
deposed, if a layman, to be anathematised</span></em>. The
council added, that those who adhered to the
images were to be punished by the imperial authorities
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enemies of the doctrine of the fathers, and
breakers of the law of God</span></em>. This decision was pronounced
by the assembled bishops unanimously, and
without a single dissentient voice, which had never
been the case before. This assembly took the title of
the Seventh Ecumenical Council, and the emperor
ordered its decision to be put into execution throughout
all his dominions. The images were removed
from the churches, and those which were painted on
the walls covered with whitewash. The principal
opposition to the imperial order was offered by the
monks, who were always the chief promoters of
image-worship; and Constantine is accused of having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
repressed this opposition with a violence common
to that barbarous age. He is said to have entertained
the greatest hatred against these monks, calling
them idolaters, and their dresses the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dress of
darkness</span></em>—an opinion with which many persons will
be found to chime, I think, even in our own time.
Constantine died in 775, and was followed on the
throne by his son, Leo IV., who inherited the religious
views of his father; whilst his wife, Irene, a
beautiful and talented, but ambitious and unprincipled
woman, was a secret worshipper of images.
Leo, who was of a weak constitution, died after a
reign of five years, appointing Irene the guardian
of his minor son Constantine, who was then ten
years old. Irene governed the empire with great
ability, but was too fond of power to surrender it to
her son at his coming of age, and he tried to obtain
by force what was due to him by right. The party
of Irene proved, however, the stronger; and young
Constantine was taken prisoner, and his mother
caused him to be deprived of sight. Irene's orders
were executed in such an atrocious manner, that the
unfortunate prince died in consequence.<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> Irene
governed the empire with great splendour, but her
first object was to restore the worship of images; and
the machinations by which she accomplished this
object have been so well related by Gibbon,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that I cannot do better than copy his account of
them:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Under the reign of Constantine VIII., the
union of the civil and ecclesiastical power had overthrown
the tree, without extirpating the root of
superstition. The idols, for such they were now
held, were secretly cherished by the order and the
sex most prone to devotion; and the fond alliance
of the monks and females obtained a final victory
over the reason and authority of man. Leo
IV. maintained with less rigour the religion of
his father and grandfather, but his wife, the fair and
ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the Athenians,<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>
the heirs of the idolatry rather than philosophy
of their ancestors. During the life of her
husband, these sentiments were inflamed by danger
and dissimulation, and she could only labour to protect
and promote some favourite monks, whom she
drew from their caverns, and seated on the metropolitan
thrones of the east. But as soon as she reigned
in her own name, and in that of her son, Irene more
seriously undertook the ruin of the iconoclasts, and
the first step of her future persecution was a general
edict for liberty of conscience. In the restoration of
the monks, a thousand images were exposed to the
public veneration; a thousand legends were invented
of their sufferings and miracles. By the opportunities
of death and removal, the episcopal seats were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
judiciously filled; the most eager competitors for
celestial or earthly favour anticipated and flattered
the judgment of their sovereign; and the promotion
of her secretary Tarasius gave Irene the patriarch of
Constantinople, and the command of the Oriental
church. But the decrees of a general council could
only be repealed by a similar assembly; the iconoclasts,
whom she convened, were bold in possession,
and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the
bishops was re-echoed by the more formidable clamour
of the soldiers and the people of Constantinople.
The delay and intrigues of a year, the separation
of the disaffected troops, and the choice of
Nice for a second orthodox synod, removed these
obstacles; and the episcopal conscience was again,
after the Greek fashion, in the hands of the
prince.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gibbon's Roman Empire</span></span>, chap. xlix.
This council, held in 786, restored the worship of
images by the unanimous sentence of three hundred
and fifty bishops. The acts of this synod have been
preserved, and they are stated by Gibbon to be <span class="tei tei-q">“a
curious monument of superstition and ignorance, of
falsehood and folly.”</span> I am afraid that there is but
too much truth in this severe judgment of Gibbon;
and the following passage relating to the same
council, which I have extracted, not from Gibbon,
or any writer of the school to which he belonged,
but from the celebrated Roman Catholic
historian of the church, Abbé Fleury, will enable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the reader to form his own judgment on this
subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After describing the confession of faith signed
by that council, which declared that the images
of the saints are to be worshipped, because they remind
us of those whom they represent, and make us
participators in their merits, he says:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The last passages showed that God was making
miracles by means of images; and in order to confirm
it, a discourse, ascribed to St Athanasius, was read.
It contained the account of a pretended miracle,
which happened at Beryt, with an image of Christ,
which, having been pierced by the Jews, emitted
blood, which healed many sick persons. The fathers
of the council were so much moved by this account
that they shed tears. It is, however, certain, that
this discourse is not by St Athanasius, and it is even
very doubtful whether the story which it contains is
true. Thus it appears that amongst all the bishops
present at this council, there was not a single one
versed in the science of criticism, because many other
false documents were produced in that assembly.
This proves nothing against the decision of the council,
because it is sufficiently supported by true documents.
It only proves the ignorance of the times,
as well as the necessity of knowing history, chronology,
the difference of manners and styles, in order
to discern real documents from spurious ones.”</span><a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>

Thus, according to the authority of one of the most
eminent writers of the Roman Catholic Church, the
second Council of Nice, the first synod which has
given an explicit and solemn sanction to one of the
most important tenets of the Western and the Eastern
churches, was composed of such ignorant and silly
prelates, that an absurd fable, contained in a forged
paper, could sway their minds and hearts in such a
manner as to make them shed tears of emotion, and
that there was not a single individual amongst these
venerable fathers sufficiently informed to be able to
discover a fabrication so gross that it did not escape
the attention of scholars who lived many centuries
afterwards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Irene rigorously enforced the decrees of this council
against the opponents of images; and that woman,
guilty of the death of her own son, and suspected
of that of her husband, is extolled by ecclesiastical
writers as a most pious princess. A contemporary
Greek writer, and a zealous defender of image-worship,
the monk Theodore Studites, places her
above Moses, and says that <span class="tei tei-q">“she had delivered the
people from the Egyptian bondage of impiety;”</span> and
the historian of the Roman Catholic Church, Baronius,
justifies her conduct by the following argument:
that the hands of the fathers were raised by a just
command of God against their children, who followed
strange gods, and that Moses had ordered them to
consecrate themselves to the Lord, even every man
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon his son, and upon his brother, Exod. xxxii. 29,
so that it was a high degree of piety to be cruel to
one's own son; consequently Irene deserved on this
account the first crown of paradise; and that if
she had committed the murder of her son from motives
of ambition, she would be worse than Agrippina,
mother of Nero; but if she did it through zeal
for religion, as it appears by the encomium which
she had received from very holy men who lived at
that time, she deserves to be praised for her piety.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Irene's piety, shown by the restoration of images,
and the persecution of their opponents, was indeed
so much appreciated by the church, that she received
a place amongst the saints of the Greek calendar.
She was, however, less fortunate in her worldly affairs;
because she was deposed in 802 by Nicephorus,
who occupied the imperial throne, and exiled to
Lesbos, where she died in great poverty. He did not
abolish the images, nor allow the persecution of their
opponents; and the ecclesiastical writers represent
him, on account of this liberal policy, as a perfect
monster. Nicephorus perished in a battle against the
Bulgarians in 811, and his successor Michael, who
persecuted the iconoclasts, unable to maintain himself
on the throne, retired into a convent, after a
reign of about two years, and the imperial crown
was assumed by Leo V., a native of Armenia, and
one of the most eminent leaders of the army, which
elevated him to this dignity.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though all that we know about Leo V. is derived
from authors zealously opposed to his religious views,
yet, notwithstanding all their <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">odium
theologicum</span></span>, they
are obliged to admit that he was gallant in the field,
and just and careful in the administration of civil
affairs. Being the native of a country whose church
still resisted the introduction of images, he was naturally
adverse to their worship, and the manner in
which he abolished it in his empire deserves a particular
notice; because, though related by his enemies, it
proves that he was a sincere scriptural Christian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to their relation, Leo believed that the
victories obtained by the barbarians, and other
calamities to which the empire was exposed, were
a visitation of God in punishment of the worship of
images; that he demanded that a precept for adoring
the images should be shown to him in the gospels, and
as the thing was impossible, he rejected them as idols
condemned by the Word of God. They also say, that
the attention of Leo being once drawn to this passage
of the prophet Isaiah, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">To whom then will you
liken God? or what likeness will you compare unto
him? The workman melteth a graven image, and the
goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver
chains</span></em>,”</span> (xl. 18, 19,) this circumstance irritated
him more than any thing else against the images.
He communicated his sentiments to the patriarch,
and requested him either to remove the images, or
to show a reason why they were worshipped, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">since
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
the Scriptures did not order it</span></em>. The patriarch, who
was an adherent of the images, tried to elude this demand
by various sophisms, which, not having satisfied
the emperor, he ordered divines of both parties to
assemble in his palace, and represented to them that
Moses, who had received the law, written with the
hand of God, condemned, in the most explicit terms,
those who adored the works of men's hands; that it was
idolatry to worship them, and great folly to attempt
to confine the Infinite in a picture of the size of an
ell. It is said that the defenders of the images refused
to speak for the three following reasons:—1.
That the canons prohibited to doubt what had been
determined by the second Council of Nice; 2. That
the clergy could not deliberate upon such matters in
the imperial palace, but in a church; and, 3. That
the emperor was not a competent judge on this occasion,
because he was resolved to abolish the images.
The emperor deposed the patriarch, who defended the
images, replacing him by another who shared his own
sentiments, and convened a council, which, with the
exception of a few of its members, decided for the abolition
of the images. The emperor ordered their removal,
and sent several of their defenders into exile;
he soon, however, allowed them to return, and only
some few of the most zealous of them died in exile.
The most celebrated of these sufferers was Theodore
Studites; and as he has obtained on this account
the honour of saintship, his opinions on the nature of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
images deserve a particular notice. He maintained
that as the shadow cannot be separated from the
body, as the rays of the sun are inseparable from that
planet, so the images are inseparable from the subjects
which they represent. He pretended that an image
of Christ should be treated as if it were Christ himself,
saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The image is nothing else than Christ
himself, except the difference of their essence; therefore,
the worship of the image is the worship of
Jesus Christ</span></em>.”</span> He considered those who were
removing images as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">destroyers of the incarnation
of Christ, because he does not exist if he cannot be
painted</span></em>. We renounce Christ if we reject his image;
and refuse to worship him, if we refuse to adore his
image.”</span><a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This defence of image-worship is, I think, a
faithful exposition of the anthropomorphistic ideas,
which, as I have mentioned before, p. <a href="#Pg009" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>, had been
chiefly generated by the morbid imagination of the
Egyptian monks, and were supported by that numerous
class, which formed the most zealous and efficient
defenders of the images. Leo V. was murdered in a
church in 820; and Michael II., surnamed the Stammerer,
whom the conspirators placed on the throne,
did not allow the images to be restored, though he
was moderate in his religious views. He recalled the
defenders of the images from exile, and seemed to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
steer a middle course between the enemies and the
defenders of images, though he shared the opinions
of the former. He was succeeded in 829 by his son,
Theophilus,—a most decided opponent of images,—and
whose valour and love of justice are acknowledged
by his religious adversaries. He died in 841,
leaving a minor son, Michael III., under the regency
of his wife, Theodora. This princess, whose personal
character was irreproachable, governed the empire
during thirteen years, with considerable wisdom; but
being an adherent of images, she restored their worship,<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a>
which has since that time continued in the
Greek Church in perhaps even a more exaggerated
form than in the Roman Catholic one, and which
can be without any impropriety called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">iconolatry</span></span>,
since <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">idolatry</span></span> may be perhaps considered as an expression
too strong for ears polite.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The struggle between the iconoclasts and the iconolaters,
of which I have given a mere outline, but
which agitated the Eastern empire for nearly a century
and a half, ending in the complete triumph of
the latter, deserves the particular attention of all
thinking Protestants; because it is virtually the
same contest that has been waged for more than
three centuries between Protestantism and Rome,<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and which seems now to assume a new phasis. I
do not think that the ignorance of those times may
be considered as the principal cause of the triumph
of the iconolatric party, and that the spread of
knowledge in our own day is a sufficient safeguard
against the recurrence of a similar contingency.
There was in the eighth and ninth centuries a
considerable amount of learning at Constantinople,
where the treasures of classical literature, many of
which have since been lost, were preserved and
studied.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> The Greeks of that time, though no doubt
greatly inferior to the modern Europeans in physical
science, were not so in metaphysics and letters,
whilst the gospel could be read by all the educated
classes in its original tongue, which was the official,
literary, and ecclesiastical language of the Eastern
empire. The Byzantine art was, moreover, very inferior
to that of modern Europe, and could not produce,
except on some coarse and rustic intellects,
that bewitching effect, which the works of great
modern painters and sculptors often produce upon
many refined and imaginative minds. It has been
justly remarked, by an accomplished writer of our
day, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the all-emancipating press is occasionally
neutralised by the soul-subduing miracles of art.”</span><a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“The remark of a heathen poet is corroborated by
the observations of the most celebrated amongst ancient
and modern Christian writers. So persuaded
was St Paulinus of Nola, fourteen hundred years ago,
of the efficacy possessed by paintings for conveying
useful lessons of instruction, that he adorned with a
variety of sacred subjects the walls of a church which
he erected, and dedicated to God in honour of St
Felix.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Prudentius assures us how much his devotion
was enkindled, as he gazed upon the sufferings of
martyrs, so feelingly depicted around their tombs and
in their churches. On his way to Rome, about the
year 405, the poet paid a visit to the shrine of St
Cassianus, at Forum Cornelii, the modern Imola,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
where the body of that Christian hero reposed, under

So moved was Prudentius, that he threw
himself upon the pavement, kissed the altar with
religious reverence, and numbering up with many a
tear those wounds that sin had inflicted upon his
soul, concluded by exhorting every one to unite with
himself in intrusting their petitions for the divine
clemency to the solicitude of the holy martyr Cassianus,
who will not only hear our request, but will
afford us the benefit of his patronage.”</span><a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The anecdote of Prudentius evidently proves that
what originally had been intended for the instruction
of the people, may very easily become an object
of their adoration. If a man of a superior education,
like Prudentius,<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> could be carried away by his feelings
in such a manner as to address his prayers to a
dead man, how much greater must be the effect of
images upon less cultivated minds! and I have related,
p. <a href="#Pg088" class="tei tei-ref">88</a>, on the authority of the great Roman
Catholic historian, Fleury, that the fathers of the
second Council of Nice, who, according to the same
authority, were a very ignorant set, shed tears at the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sight of an image represented in an absurd and fictitious

Such are the effects produced in teaching religion
by means of images. There can be no doubt about
the truth of the observations contained in the lines
of Horace, which the author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hierurgia”</span> quotes in
defence of images; but these observations refer to
the theatre, and it appears to me that the application
of purely scenic precepts to the house of God is
something very like converting divine service into a
comedy.

The limits of this essay allow me not to discuss
the chances of an iconolatric reaction in our days. I
shall only observe, that in several countries where
the iconoclasts of the Reformation had gained a
predominant position, they were entirely crushed by
the iconolatric reaction, and that a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fond alliance of
females and monks</span></em>, supported by the ruling powers
of the state, achieved in these parts as great a victory
as that which it obtained in the east under
Irene and Theodora, not only over the reason of
man, but even over the authority of the Word of
God; and I believe that the only human means of
preventing similar contingencies are free institutions,
which allow the fullest liberty of discussion in regard
to all religious opinions.

I have said before, p. <a href="#Pg082" class="tei tei-ref">82</a>, that the Pope opposed
the abolition of images proclaimed by the Emperor
Leo III., and that this opposition was shared
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the imperial provinces of Italy, which revolted
on that occasion against their sovereign, and separated
from the Byzantine empire. It was therefore
natural that the second Council of Nice, which restored
the worship of images, should obtain the approbation
of Pope Hadrian I.; but his desire to impose the
enactments of that council upon the churches of the
West met with a decided opposition on the part of
Charlemagne. This great monarch, who is so celebrated
by his efforts to convert the Pagan Saxons,
prosecuted with all the barbarity of his age, and
whom the church has placed amongst her saints, was
so offended by the enactments of the second Council
of Nice in favour of the worship of images, that he
composed, or what is more probable, ordered to be
composed in his name, a book against that worship,
and sent it to Pope Hadrian I., as an exposition
of his own sentiments, as well as of those of his
bishops, on the subject in question. This work,
though written in violent language, contains many
very rational views about images, and unanswerable
arguments against all kinds of adoration offered to
them. The substance of this celebrated protest is
as follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Charlemagne says, that there is no harm in having
images in a church, provided they are not worshipped;
and that the Greeks had fallen into two extremes,
one of which was to destroy the images, as had been
ordained by the Council of Constantinople, under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Constantine Copronymus, and the other to worship
them, as was decided by the second Council of
Nice under Irene. He censures much more severely
this latter extreme than the former, because those
who destroyed images had merely acted with levity
and ignorance, whilst it was a wicked and profane
action to worship them. He compared the first to
such as mix water with wine, and the others to
those who infuse a deadly poison into it; in short,
there could be no comparison between the two cases.
He marks, with great precision, the different kinds
of worship offered to the images, rejecting all of
them. The second Council of Nice decided that this
worship should consist of kisses and genuflexions, as
well as of burning incense and wax candles before
them. All these practices are condemned by Charlemagne,
as so many acts of worship offered to a created
being. He addresses the defenders of the worship of
images in the following manner:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You who establish the purity of your faith upon
images, go, if you like, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and fall upon your knees and
burn incense before them</span></em>; but with regard to ourselves
we shall seek the precepts of God in his Holy
Writ. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Light luminaries before your pictures</span></em>, whilst
we shall read the Scriptures. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Venerate, if you like,
colours</span></em>; but we shall worship divine mysteries.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Enjoy the agreeable sight of your pictures</span></em>; but we
shall find our delight in the Word of God. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Seek
after figures which cannot either see, or hear, or
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
taste</span></em>; but we shall diligently seek after the law of
God, which is irreprehensible.”</span> He further says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“I
see images which have such inscriptions, as for
instance St Paul, and I ask, therefore, those who are
involved in this great error, why they do call images
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holy (sanctus)</span></em>, and why they do not say, conformably
to the tradition of the fathers, that these are
images of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saints</span></em>? Let them say in what consists
the sanctity of the images? Is it in the wood
which had been brought from a forest in order to
make them? Is it in the colours with which they
are painted, and which are often composed of impure
substances? Is it in the wax, which gets dirty?”</span>
He taunts the worshippers of images, pointing out
an abuse which even now is as inevitable as it was
then. <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“two pictures perfectly alike,
but of which one is meant for the Virgin and the
other for Venus, are presented to you, you will inquire
which of them is the image of the Virgin and
which is that of Venus, because you cannot distinguish
them. The painter will call one of these pictures
the image of the Virgin, and it will be immediately
put up in a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">high place, honoured, and kissed</span></em>; whilst
the other, representing Venus, will be thrown away
with horror. These two pictures are, however, made
by the same hand, with the same brush, with the
same colours; they have the same features, and
the whole difference between them lies in their inscriptions.
Why is the one received and the other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rejected? It is not on account of the sanctity which
one of them has, and the other has not; it is, then,
on account of its inscription; and yet certain letters
attached to a picture cannot give it a sanctity which
it otherwise had not.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This decree of the Council of Frankfort is very important,
because it not only condemned the worship
of images, but it virtually rejected the infallibility
of the Popes, as well as of the General Councils,
since it condemned what they had established.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The opposition to the worship of images continued
amongst the Western churches for some time after
the death of Charlemagne. Thus an assembly of the
French clergy, held at Paris in 825, condemned the
decree of the second Council of Nice as decidedly
as it was done by the work of Charlemagne and the
Council of Frankfort. Claudius, bishop of Turin,
who lived about that time, opposed the worship of
images, which he removed from his churches, calling
those idolaters who adhered to this practice; he also
condemned the adoration of relics, of the figure of
the cross, &amp;c.; and he was not inaptly called, on this
account, by the Jesuit historian Maimbourg, the first
Protestant minister.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are other traces of a similar opposition
during the ninth century, but it seems to have entirely
disappeared in the tenth, and it was again renewed
by the Albigenses in the eleventh century.
Their history, however, is foreign to the object of the
present essay; and I shall endeavour to give in my
next chapter a short sketch of the legends of the
saints, composed during the middle ages.

Or Lives Of Saints, During The Middle Ages.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A collection of the lives of the saints of the Roman
Catholic calendar has been accomplished by
the Jesuits, and is well known as that of the Bollandists,
from the name of its first originator Bollandus.
It extends to fifty-three huge folios, though
it has reached only to the middle of October,<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a>
each day having a number of saints assigned to it
for commemoration. It contains, among a mass of
the greatest absurdities, a good deal of valuable
information relating to the history of the middle
ages, particularly in respect to the customs and prevailing
ideas of that period. A great, if not the
greatest part of the saints whose lives are described
in that collection have never existed, except in the
imagination of their biographers; and the best proof
of this is that the learned Benedictine monk, Dom
Ruinart, an intimate friend and collaborator of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
celebrated Mabillon, has reduced the acts of martyrs,
whom he considers as true, to one moderate
quarto, though the same work contains a refutation
of the Protestant Dodwell, who maintained that the
number of the primitive martyrs had been greatly
exaggerated by their historians.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Christian church was already, at an early
period of her existence, disturbed by a great number
of forgeries, relating to the history and doctrine of
our Lord and his disciples;<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a> but the spirit in which
they were written, so contrary to that of the true
Gospel, and the gross absurdities which they contain,
were convincing proofs of the apocryphal character
of those writings, which, consequently, were rejected
as such from the canon of Scripture. If the church
could not escape such abuses at a time when she was
not yet infected by Pagan ideas and practices, she
became still more exposed to them after the abovementioned
corruptions, and when, as has already
been said, p. <a href="#Pg020" class="tei tei-ref">20</a>, the Christian society was invaded
by whole populations, who, notwithstanding their
abjuration of heathenism, were Pagans in their
manners, their tastes, their prejudices, and their
ignorance. There were, moreover, very great difficulties
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in obtaining authentic information about the
lives of the martyrs. I have said, p. <a href="#Pg003" class="tei tei-ref">3</a>, that their memory
was usually preserved in the churches to which
they had belonged. This was, however, entirely a local
affair, and though the report of such events had undoubtedly
circulated amongst other Christian congregations,
there was no general register of martyrs
preserved by the whole church, which had no central
point of union. The means of communication between
various places were, moreover, at that time
very imperfect, and this difficulty was increased by
the persecutions to which the primitive churches were
often exposed. These persecutions dispersed many
churches, destroying their registers and other documents
belonging to them, whilst even a much greater
number of them experienced a similar calamity from
the barbarian nations who successively invaded the
Roman empire. The accounts of the sufferings and
death of the martyrs rest, therefore, with the exception
of some comparatively few well-authenticated cases,
upon the authority of vague and uncertain traditions.
These traditions were generally collected and put in
writing only centuries after the time when the event
to which they relate had, or is supposed to have
taken place. It was therefore no wonder that the
subjects of many such accounts are purely imaginary.
The nature of the generality of these legends, or
lives of martyrs and other saints, may be judged of
best from the following opinion expressed on this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
subject by a Roman Catholic clergyman of unsuspected
orthodoxy:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What shall I say of those saints of whose life we
don't know either the beginning or the progress,—of
those saints to whom so many praises are given,
though nobody knows anything about their end?
Who may pray to them to intercede for him, when it
is impossible to know what degree of credit they
enjoy with God? We shall be obliged, indeed, to
consider the most part of the acts of martyrs, which
are now produced with so much confidence, as so
many fables, and reject them as nothing better than
romances. It is true that their lives are written, like
that of St Ovidius, St Felicissimus, and St Victor!
But, O God! what lives! what libels! lives deserving
a place in the Index of the Prohibited Books,
since they are filled with falsehoods, vain conjectures,
or, to say the least, are ascribing to unknown and
apocryphal saints the true acts of the most illustrious
martyrs. Such things cannot but bring about a great
confusion in the history of the church, not to say in
religion itself. It is in this manner that the actions
of St Felicissimus, who is generally believed to have
been a deacon to St Sixtus, are ascribed to a new
Felicissimus; and the virtues of St Victor of Milan
are now given to a new Victor, who has been recently
brought to Paris. As regards the life of St Ovidius,
is there anything in it more than words and
words? and can we find in it anything solid? This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
little book speaks of a leaden plate upon which the
senatorial dignity and the year of this saint's martyrdom
are inscribed. Why is not this inscription
given? Why is not at least the precise date of his
martyrdom named? It is said that St Ovidius suffered
towards the end of the second century; is this
the manner of fixing the year of his death? No,
no; the ancients did not mark the time in such a
manner; they did not take an uncertain century for
the certain epoch of a year. I am much afraid that
this inscription is by no means so authentic as people
wish to persuade us. But there was found in his
grave a little glass vessel; a palm is engraved upon
his sepulchre; and his skull has the appearance of
being pierced with a lance. Well, these marks may
prove that St Ovidius was a martyr; but are they
sufficient to establish the truth of his life, such as it
has been published?”</span><a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would, however, observe, that many writers of
the lives of saints, without excepting those who are
considered legitimate, have rendered themselves
guilty of something worse than the plagiarism of
which the learned Mabillon complains in the passage
given above. They may be accused of having
blasphemously parodied the Scriptures, and particularly
the Gospels, by ascribing many of the miracles
recorded in the Bible to the subjects of their biographies.
M. Maury, the French savant whom I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have already quoted (p. <a href="#Pg011" class="tei tei-ref">11</a>), has traced a great number
of miracles ascribed to various saints, which are
nothing but imitations of this kind. This sacrilegious
plagiarism is not confined to the middle ages,
but has been practised in modern times, as is evident
from the two following miracles ascribed to the
celebrated Jesuit saint, Francis Xavier, who died in
1552. It is said that during his residence in Japan
a woman of his acquaintance lost her daughter, after
having sought in vain during her illness for St
Francis, who was absent on some journey. At his
return the bereaved mother fell at his feet, and said,
weeping, like Martha to our Saviour, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, if thou
hadst been here, my daughter had not died,”</span>—(John
xi. 21.) The saint, moved by the entreaties of the
mother, ordered her to open the grave of her daughter,
and restored her to life. Another time the same
saint said to a father whose daughter had died, in
the same manner as Jesus Christ said to the centurion
whose servant was sick, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go thy way; thy
daughter is healed.”</span><a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Had these miracles been performed in our part
of the world, they would have converted crowds of
Protestants, and thus greatly advanced the principal
object of the order to which St Francis Xavier belonged;
but the air of Europe seems to have been
unfavourable for such wonderful experiments, since
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the good saint was obliged to betake himself to Japan
in order successfully to perform them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true that the legend writers make no attempt
at concealing these imitations, but, on the contrary,
insist upon the likeness of the miracles performed by
their saint to those of our Saviour, as a proof of the
high degree of sanctity attained by the former. No
saint, however, of the Roman Catholic or Græco-Russian
calendar had so many miracles ascribed to
him, particularly of the kind mentioned above, as St
Francis of Assisi, the celebrated founder of the mendicant
monks, and who, considering the immense influence
which his disciples have exercised on the
Catholic world, was perhaps one of the most extraordinary
characters which the middle ages produced.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been frequently observed, that genius is
akin to madness, and that the partition by which
the two are separated is so thin that it occasionally
becomes quite imperceptible. Such a condition of
the human mind has perhaps never been exemplified
in a more striking manner than by the life of
this famous saint, which presents a strange mixture
of the noblest acts of charity and self-devotion, the
wildest freaks of a madman, and of genial conceptions
worthy of the most eminent statesman and
philosopher. The best proof of his genius is the
great influence which the order instituted by him has
exercised during several centuries in many countries,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and which even now has not yet lost its vitality. It
must also be admitted, that neither St Francis nor
his disciples can be charged with any of those atrocities
by which the life of his contemporary St Dominic,
of bloody memory, the founder of the inquisition,
and the preacher of the crusade against the Albigenses,
as well as the annals of his order, are stained.
Neither can it be denied that Francis, as well as
his followers, have on many occasions mitigated
the barbarity of their age. His immense popularity
is, however, as I think, chiefly due to the circumstance
that his order, principally destined to act upon
the lower classes, was recruited from the most numerous
and most ignorant part of the population; and
is it necessary to observe that the less men are educated,
the more they are prone to credulity and exaggeration?
Much learning was not required for the
admission to this democratic order, and its ranks
were increased by the creation of a class whose members
remained in the world, binding themselves only
to the observation of some devotional practices and
moral precepts. All this contributed to spread the
order of St Francis, to which both sexes are admitted,
with a marvellous rapidity over many countries; at the
same time its members were extolling the virtues and
supposed miracles of their founder in the most exaggerated
and often ludicrous manner, of which the following
anecdote may serve as a specimen:—A Franciscan
monk, who was one day preaching about the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
merits of the founder of his order, began his sermon in
the following manner: <span class="tei tei-q">“Where shall I place the great
St Francis? Amongst the saints? This is not enough
for his merits. Amongst the angels? no, 'tis not
enough. Amongst the archangels? 'tis not enough.
Amongst the seraphims? 'tis not enough. Amongst
the cherubims? 'tis not enough.”</span> He was, however,
on a sudden released, by one of his hearers, from
his perplexity about a proper location for his saint,
who, rising from his seat, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Reverend father, as
I see that you cannot find for St Francis a proper
place in heaven, I shall give up to him mine on this
bench;”</span> which having said, he left the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The story does not say whether this good monk
was satisfied with the place so unexpectedly offered to
his saint, or where he would have stopped without
this timely interruption; but we know, from many
other cases, that St Francis was compared by his
disciples to our Saviour. Thus, in a work published
by the Father Bartholomeus of Pisa, and entitled
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Golden Book of the Conformities of the Life
of St Francis with that of Jesus Christ,”</span><a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> the author
maintains that the birth of St Francis was announced
by prophets; that he had twelve disciples,
one of whom, called John Capella, was rejected by
him, like Judas Iscariot by our Lord; that he had
been tempted by the devil, but without success;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that he was transfigured; that he had suffered the
same passion as our Saviour, though he never was
subject to any persecution or ill-usage, but died
quietly, in 1218, amidst his devoted admirers. Other
writers pushed even farther the blasphemous comparison,
boasting that St Francis had performed
many more miracles than our Lord, because Christ
changed water into wine but once, whilst St Francis
did it thrice; and that instead of the few miraculous
cures mentioned in the Gospels, St Francis and his
disciples had opened the eyes of more than a thousand
blind, cured more than a thousand lame, and
restored to life more than a thousand dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The greatest miracle, however, that has ever been
wrought by St Francis has taken place in our own
days, and its authenticity admits of no doubt whatever.
It is a life of this famous saint, published by
M. Chavin de Malan; and my readers may form
an adequate idea of its contents by the following
extract from an admirable article in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Edinburgh
Review”</span> for July 1847:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Though amongst the
most passionate and uncompromising devotees of the
Church of Rome, M. Chavin de Malan also is in one
sense a Protestant. He protests against any exercise
of human reason in examining any dogma which
that church inculcates, or any fact which she alleges.
The most merciless of her cruelties affect him with
no indignation, the silliest of her prodigies with no
shame, the basest of her superstitions with no contempt.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Her veriest dotage is venerable in his eyes.
Even the atrocities of Innocent III. seem to this
all-extolling eulogist but to augment the triumph
and the glories of his reign. If the soul of the confessor
of Simon de Montfort, retaining all the passions
and all the prejudices of that era, should transmigrate
into a doctor of the Sorbonne, conversant
with the arts and literature of our own times, the
result might be the production of such an ecclesiastical
history as that of which we have here a specimen,—elaborate
in research, glowing in style, vivid
in portraiture, utterly reckless and indiscriminate in
belief, extravagant up to the very verge of idolatry
in applause, and familiar far beyond the verge of indecorum
with the most awful topics and objects of
the Christian faith.”</span>—(Pp. 1, 2.)<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, I ask my reader whether the publication
of such a work, in the year of grace 1845, at Paris,
is not a perfect miracle, and undoubtedly much more
genuine than all those which it describes?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We live indeed in an age of wonders, physical as
well as moral, and neither of them have escaped the
all-powerful influence of the great moving spring of
our time, and the principal cause of its rapid
advance,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, competition. England, which is foremost
in many, and not behind in any, inventions
and discoveries of the day, has maintained her rank,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and even perhaps gone ahead, in the production of
such moral miracles as that of which I have given a
specimen above. And, indeed, the lives of the English
saints, published in the years 1844 and 1845, in
the capital of this Protestant country, may fearlessly
challenge a comparison with the work of M. Chavin
de Malan. They are, moreover, ascribed to a clergyman
of the Church of England, who, though he has
since gone over to Rome, was at that time receiving
the wages of the Protestant Establishment of this
country as one of its servants and defenders.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> The
few following extracts from this curious work will
enable my readers to judge whether I have over-estimated
the capabilities of this work for a successful
competition with its French rival:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Many of these (legends) are so well fitted to
illustrate certain principles which should be borne in
mind in considering mediæval miracles, that they deserve
some attention. Not that any thing here said
is intended to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prove</span></em> that the stories of miracles, said
to be wrought in the middle ages, are true. Men
will always believe or disbelieve their truth, in proportion
as they are disposed to admit or reject the
antecedent probability of the existence of a perpetual
church, endowed with unfailing divine powers. And
the reason of this is plain. Ecclesiastical miracles
presuppose Catholic faith, just as Scripture miracles,
and Scripture itself, presuppose the existence of God.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Men, therefore, who disbelieve the faith, will of course
disbelieve the story of the miracles, which, if it is not
appealed to as a proof of the faith, at least takes it
for granted. For instance, the real reason for rejecting
the account of the vision which appeared to
St Waltheof in the holy Eucharist, must be disbelief
of the Catholic doctrine.”</span><a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The miracle alluded to above, and which cannot
be rejected without disbelief in the Catholic doctrine,
is as follows:—<span class="tei tei-q">“On Christmas-day, when the convent
was celebrating the nativity of our Lord, as
the friar was elevating the host, in the blessed sacrifice
of the mass, he saw in his hand a child fairer
than the children of men, having on his head a crown
of gold studded with jewels. His eyes beamed with
light, and his face was more radiant than the whitest
snow; and so ineffably sweet was his countenance,
that the friar kissed the feet and the hands of the
heavenly child. After this the divine vision disappeared,
and Waltheof found in his hands the consecrated
water.”</span><a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole collection is full of similar stories, some
of which are really outrageous; as, for instance, that
which it relates about St Augustine, the great apostle
of England.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This saint was, during his peregrinations about
the country, received with great honours in the north
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of England; <span class="tei tei-q">“but,”</span> says the work in question, <span class="tei tei-q">“very
different from this are the accounts of his travels in
Dorsetshire. While there, we hear of his having
come to one village, where he was received with
every species of insult. The wretched people, not
content with heaping abusive words upon the holy
visitors, assailed them with missiles, in which work,
the place being probably a sea-port, the sellers
of fish are related to have been peculiarly active.
Hands, too, were laid upon the archbishop and his
company. Finding all efforts useless, the godly
company shook the dust from their feet, and withdrew.
The inhabitants are said to have suffered the
penalty of their impieties, even to distant generations.
All the children born from that time bore
and transmitted the traces of their parents' sins in
the shape of a loathsome deformity.”</span><a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The writer who relates this story had not the
courage or the honesty of M. Chavin de Malan to
tell that the insult offered to the holy visitors consisted
in attaching tails of fish to their robes, and
that the loathsome deformity, with which the children
of the perpetrators of that insult were born
during many generations, was a tail.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Absurd as this monkish story is, it is nevertheless
characteristic of the spirit of the sacerdotal pride
and vindictiveness which would punish a silly joke,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by which the dignity of the priestly order was
offended, with a heavy calamity, entailed upon the
innocent descendants of its perpetrators through
many generations; and yet the fables of this modern
mythology cannot be, according to our author,
rejected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without disbelief of the Catholic doctrine</span></em>.
This is not, however, his personal opinion; and he
has only asserted, in a more decisive manner than it
has been done for a considerable time, a principle
which the Roman Catholic Church cannot disavow,
though it may place her in an embarrassing position;
and as an illustration of this, I shall give the
following anecdote:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under the reign of Frederic II., a Prussian soldier
stole a costly ornament from an image of the
Virgin, which enjoyed a great reputation for its miraculous
powers. The theft being discovered, the
culprit pleaded in his defence that, having addressed
a fervent prayer to the above-mentioned image for
help in his poverty, it gave him this ornament to
relieve him from his distress. This affair was reported
to the king, who, being much amused by the
soldier's device, required the Roman Catholic bishop
in whose diocese this theft was committed to give a
positive opinion whether the image in question could
work miracles of this kind or not? The bishop could
not, without showing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disbelief in the Catholic doctrine</span></em>,
deny the possibility of the miracle, and was
therefore obliged to give an affirmative reply. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
king, therefore, pardoned the soldier, on condition
of never accepting presents from this or any other
image or saint whatever.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The author of this essay, though a firm believer
in the existence of God and the truth of the Scriptures,
has not the advantage of being inspired with
faith in the Catholic doctrine; he therefore will continue
his researches in the same manner as before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many legends originated from misunderstanding
the emblematic character of some pictures. Thus
the celebrated Spanish lady saint and authoress, St
Theresa, was, on account of her eloquent and impassioned
effusions of love addressed to the Deity,
painted by a Spanish artist having her heart pierced

Psalmist, <span class="tei tei-q">“For thine arrows stick fast in me,”</span> &amp;c.—(Ps.
xxxviii. 2.) She died quietly in her convent
towards the end of the sixteenth century, and though
the particulars of her life and death are generally
known, there were some legend writers who related
that she died a martyr, pierced by an arrow. If
such confusion of ideas could happen in a time
when literature and science had made considerable
progress, and when the art of printing was already
universally known, how much more frequently such
things must have occurred during the prevailing
ignorance of the middle ages! And, indeed, there
are many wild legends which have originated from
a similar source, and of which the most celebrated is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that of St Denis, which has been also related of
other saints. This martyr, supposed to have been
beheaded, was represented holding his head in his
hand, as an emblem of the manner of his death.
The writer of his legend took this emblem for
the representation of a real fact, and loosening
the reins of his imagination, related that the saint,
after having been beheaded, took up his head, kissed
it, and walked away with it.<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a>

It is a general tendency of a gross and unenlightened
mind to materialise the most abstract
and spiritual ideas, and then what is simply an allegory
becomes with him a reality. It was this tendency
which, during the mediæval ignorance, gave
often a literal sense to what is only typical, and it
was carried so far that even the parables of our Lord
were constructed into real stories. Thus, Lazarus
was a poor saint who lived in great want, and was
made after his death the patron of beggars and
lepers. The parable of the prodigal son has furnished
materials for many a legend; and to crown all
these pious parodies, a monk has shown to the well-known
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Eastern traveller Hasselquist, the very spot
upon which the good Samaritan assisted the wounded
man, who had been left unheeded by the priest
and the Levite. Future rewards and punishments,
heaven and hell, were also represented in a grossly
material manner, that gave rise to many absurd
legends, generally invented with the object of supporting
the pretensions of the church, to have the
power of sending at pleasure the souls of the departed
to either of these places.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have already spoken of the effects which the
solitary and ascetic life of the early monks produced
upon their imagination. The same thing
took place amongst the recluses of the convents,
but particularly nunneries. <span class="tei tei-q">“The imaginations of
women,”</span> says a celebrated author whom I have
already quoted, <span class="tei tei-q">“as their feelings are more keen
and exquisite, are more susceptible and ungovernable
than those of men; more obnoxious to the injurious
influence of solitude; more easily won upon
by the arts of delusion, and inflamed by the contagion
of the passions.”</span> Hence we may account for
the rapidity with which in orphan houses, cloisters,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and other institutions, where numbers of the sex are
intimately connected with each other, the sickness,
humour, habits, of one, if conspicuous and distinguished,
become those of all. I remember to have
read in a medical writer of considerable merit, that
in a French convent of nuns, of more than common
magnitude, one of the sisters was seized with a
strange impulse to mew like a cat, in which singular
propensity she was shortly imitated by several other
sisters, and finally, without a solitary exception, by
the whole convent, who all joined at regular periods
in a general mew that lasted several hours. The
neighbourhood heard, with more astonishment than
edification, the daily return of this celestial symphony,
which was silenced, after many ineffectual
measures, by terrifying the modesty of the sex with
the menace, that, on any future repetition of their
concert, a body of soldiers, pretended to be stationed
at the gates of the monastery, would be called in to
inflict upon them a discipline at once shameful and
severe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Among all the epidemic fancies of the sex I
have found upon record, none equals that related by
Cardan to have displayed itself in the fifteenth century,—which
forcibly illustrates what has been remarked
of the intuitive contagion by which fantastic
affection is propagated among women. A nun in a
certain German convent was urged by an unaccountable
impulse to bite all her companions; and her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
strange caprice gradually spread to others, till the
whole body was infected by the same fury. Nor
did the evil confine itself within these limits: the
report of this strange mania travelled from one province
to another, and every where conveyed with it
the infectious folly, from cloister to cloister, through
the German empire; from thence extending itself
on each side to Holland and Italy, the nuns at length
worried one another from Rome to Amsterdam.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Numberless instances might be quoted to demonstrate
the force with which the strangest and most
wild propensities fasten themselves on the imagination,
and conquer and tyrannise over the will, when
the soul is debarred from a free intercourse with its
species, and left too uninterruptedly to its own unbridled
musings. But those which we have related
may be sufficient to show the danger into which he
runs who delivers himself unconditionally to the
custody of solitude, and does not arm himself against
its faithless hospitality. Shut up in a barren and
monotonous leisure, without studies to occupy curiosity,
without objects to amuse the senses, or to interest
and to attract the affections to any thing
human, fancy will escape into the worlds of chimerical
existence, there to seek amusement and exercise.
How fondly does it then embrace and cherish angelical
visions, or infernal phantoms, prodigies, or
miracles! or should its reveries take another direction,
with what increasing eagerness and confidence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
do its hopes hunt after the delusions of alchemy,
the fictions of philosophy, and the delirium of metaphysics!
In cases where the mind is less capacious,
and its stores less copious, it will attach itself to
some absurd notion, the child of its languid and exhausted
powers; and bestowing its fondest confidence
on this darling of its dotage, will abandon reason and
outrage common sense.”</span><a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>

I have given this lengthened extract from Zimmerman,
because I think it satisfactorily explains
those mystic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visions</span></em> as well as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">infernal phantoms</span></em>,
with which the mediæval legends and chronicles,
generally composed by monks, abound, and which
are often unjustly ascribed to fraud and wilful
deception. Medical science, as well as all the
branches of natural philosophy, being then in a very
imperfect condition, such phenomena as those of
nuns mewing like cats or biting like dogs, which
are mentioned by Zimmerman, were not explained
as nervous diseases, but ascribed to the possession of
evil spirits; and I frankly confess that I am by no
means sure, that if cases like those mentioned above
were to happen in our enlightened age, there would
not be found many good folks ascribing them to a
similar agency. It must be also remembered that,
if notwithstanding the extreme rapidity and regularity
of communications in our own time, reports of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
various events are often exaggerated and even completely
altered in passing from one place to another;
how much more must it have been the case during
the time of such defective communication as existed
previous to the invention of printing and
the introduction of the post! It was therefore no
wonder if occurrences of such an extraordinary nature
as those alluded to were immensely magnified by
report, and if it had, at least in many places, converted
the mewing and biting nuns into as many
cats and dogs. It is, moreover, now generally admitted
that what is called mesmerism, but whose
real nature science has not yet explained, was known
and practised during the middle ages, as well as in
remote antiquity, and that many thaumaturgic operations,
described by the mediæval legends, as well
as by ancient writers, were produced by means of
this still mysterious agency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have dwelt perhaps too long on this subject, because
I am afraid that the observations relating to it
are not confined to a distant period, but may become
but too often applicable to our own times. And,
indeed, when we reflect on the rapid increase of
convents and nunneries, particularly in this country,
and that notwithstanding the present state of civilization
these establishments must be filled chiefly by
individuals whose imaginations are stronger than
their reasoning powers, there can be little doubt that
they may again become the stage of those extraordinary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
manifestations, the cause of which had been
too exclusively ascribed to mediæval darkness. It
cannot be doubted, that designing individuals of both
sexes, possessed of superior talents and knowledge,
but particularly endowed with a strong will, may
exercise not only an undue influence, but even an
absolute power over the inmates of the above-mentioned
monastic establishments; and that a skilful
application of mesmerism may efficiently promote
such unlawful ends.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many local superstitious remains of Paganism,—as,
for instance, miraculous powers ascribed to certain
wells, stones, caverns,—stories about various kinds of
fairies, &amp;c.—have furnished ample materials to the
mediæval legend writers, who arranged them according
to their own views. They generally retained the
miraculous part of the story, frequently embellishing
it by their own additions, but substituting the agency
of the Christian saint, the hero of their tale, for that
of the Pagan deity, to whom it had originally been
ascribed. It was thus that the localities considered
by the Pagans as possessed of some supernatural
properties, and resorted to by them on this account,
were converted into places of Christian pilgrimages,
with the only difference that the Pagan <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genius loci</span></span>
was baptised with the name of a Christian saint,
whose existence can often be no more proved than
that of his heathen predecessor. Many hagiographers
seem to have indulged their humour as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
much as their fancy in composing these legends,
which appears from such ludicrous stories as, for
instance, that of St Fechin, whose piety was so fervent
that when he was bathing in cold water it became
almost boiling hot. This warm-hearted or
hot-headed saint is said to have belonged to the
Emerald isle, though, considering that his ardent
piety was so very much like a manifestation of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">perfervidum Scotorum ingenium</span></span>, in a somewhat
exaggerated form, I am much inclined to believe
him a native of the north country. There are many
instances of such humorous miracles, but I shall
quote only that of Laurenthios, a famous Greek saint,
and worker of miracles. Having one day some
business with the Patriarch of Constantinople, he was
kept waiting in the prelate's ante-chamber, and feeling
very warm he wanted to take off his cloak. But
as there was not any piece of furniture in the room,
nor even a peg on its walls, St Laurenthios, embarrassed
what to do with his cloak, threw it upon a ray
of the sun, which was entering the room through a
hole in the shutter, and which immediately acquired
the firmness of a rope, so that the saint's cloak
remained hanging upon it. It must not, however, be
believed that the hot sun and fervid imagination of
Greece were absolutely requisite for the performance
of such wonderful tricks; for we have sufficient legendary
evidence to prove that they were successfully
reproduced under the less brilliant sky of Germany
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and France, because St Goar of Treves suspended
his cap, and St Aicadrus, abbot of Jumieges, his
gloves upon the same piece of furniture that had been
used by St Laurenthios to hang his cloak, though
probably, considering that the sun is not so powerful
in those countries as it is at Constantinople, the western
saints did not venture to try its rays with such
a heavy load, as had been successfully done by their
eastern colleague.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some miracles were invented in order to inculcate
implicit obedience to the ecclesiastical authorities,
which is considered by the Roman Catholic Church
as one of, if not the most important virtue to be practised
by her children. Thus it is related that when
the Spanish Dominican monk, St Vincent Ferrerius,
celebrated for the great number of his miracles, was
one day walking along a street in Barcelona, a mason,
falling from a high roof, called for his assistance. The
saint answered that he could not perform a miracle
without the permission of his superior, but that
he would go and ask for it. The mason remained,
therefore, suspended in the air until St Vincent, returning
with the permission, got him safely down on
the ground.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be admitted, that many saints, whose
lives are disfigured by absurd stories of their miracles,
were men of great piety, adorned with the
noblest virtues, and who gave proofs of the most exalted
charity and self-devotion. Unfortunately the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
honours of saintship have been often bestowed upon
such sanguinary monsters as St Dominic, whose shrine
would be the most appropriately placed in a temple
where human sacrifices are offered, or upon madmen
who have outraged every feeling of humanity. Thus
it is related that St Alexius left his home on the day
of his wedding, and, having exchanged his clothes for
the rags of a beggar, adopted his mode of life. After
some time, when his appearance had become so
wretched that he could no longer be recognised by
his friends, he returned to his parental house, asking
for shelter. He obtained a place under the
staircase, and lived there by alms for seventeen years,
continually witnessing the distress and lamentations
of his wife, mother, and aged father about his loss,
and was recognised only after his death by a book
of prayers which had been given him by his mother.
And it was for this unfeeling and even cruel treatment
of his own family that he was canonised! It
is supposed, however, that all this story is but a fiction,
and, for the sake of humanity, I sincerely hope
that it is so.

I have given (p. <a href="#Pg014" class="tei tei-ref">14</a>) the opinion of an eminent
Roman Catholic modern author (Chateaubriand)
about the introduction of Pagan usages into the
Christian worship, and a long extract (pp. <a href="#Pg016" class="tei tei-ref">16-28</a>)
from another no less distinguished Roman Catholic
writer of our day, describing the cause of this corruption.
The Roman Catholic writers of this country
do not, however, treat this subject with the same sincerity
as the illustrious author of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Genie du
Christianisme,”</span> and the learned French Academician
from whose work I have so largely drawn; but
they try hard to deny that many usages of their
church bear the stamp of Paganism.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> This is particularly
the case with the author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hierurgia,”</span> a
work which I have already quoted, and which may
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be considered as the fairest expression of what the
Roman Catholic Church teaches on the subject in
question. Thus the use of images in churches is represented
as being authorised by Scripture, by the
following curious arguments:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The practice of employing images as ornaments
and memorials to decorate the temple of the Lord is
in a most especial manner approved by the Word of
God himself. Moses was commanded to place two
cherubim upon the ark, and to set up a brazen figure
of the fiery serpent, that those of the murmuring
Israelites who had been bitten might recover from
the poison of their wounds by looking on the image.
In the description of Solomon's temple, we read of
that prince, not only that he made in the oracle two
cherubim of olive tree, of ten cubits in height, but
that <span class="tei tei-q">‘all the walls of the temple round about he
carved with divers figures and carvings.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the first book of Paralipomenon (Chronicles)
we observe that when David imposed his injunction
upon Solomon to realise his intention of building a
house to the Lord, he delivered to him a description
of the porch and temple, and concluded by thus
assuring him: <span class="tei tei-q">‘All these things came to me written
by the hand of the Lord, that I may understand the
works of the pattern.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The isolated fact that images were not only
directed by the Almighty God to be placed in the
Mosaic tabernacle, and in the more sumptuous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
temple of Jerusalem, but that he himself exhibited
the pattern of them, will be alone sufficient to authorise
the practice of the Catholic Church in regard
to a similar observance.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierurgia</span></span>, p. 371.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this may be briefly answered. There was no
representation of the Jewish patriarchs or saints
either in the tabernacle or in the temple of Solomon,
as is the case with the Christian saints in the
Roman Catholic and Græco-Russian Churches; and
the brazen serpent, to which the author alludes,
was broken into pieces by order of King Hezekiah
as soon as the Israelites began to worship it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The author tries to prove, with considerable
learning and ingenuity, that the primitive Christians
ornamented their churches with images, and I have
already given, p. <a href="#Pg051" class="tei tei-ref">51</a>, his explanation of the Council
of Elvira; but his assertions are completely disproved
by every direct evidence which we have about the
places of worship of those Christians. I have already
quoted, p. <a href="#Pg007" class="tei tei-ref">7</a>, the testimony of Minutius Felix, that
the Christians had no kind of simulachres in their
temples, as well as the indignation of St Epiphanius
at an attempt to introduce them into the churches,
p. <a href="#Pg068" class="tei tei-ref">68</a>, and for which there would have been no
occasion if it had been an established custom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most important part of his defence of the use
of images is, however, the paragraph entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">No
virtue resident in images themselves</span></em>,”</span> containing
what follows:—
</p>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Not only are Catholics not exposed to such
dangers (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, idolatry), but they are expressly prohibited
by the church (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Concilium Tridentinum</span></span>, sess.
xxv.) to believe that there is any divinity or virtue
resident in images for which they should be reverenced,
or that any thing is to be asked of them, or
any confidence placed in them, but that the honour
given should be referred to those whom they represent;
and so particular are their religious instructors
in impressing this truth upon the minds of
their congregations, that if a Catholic child, who
had learned its first catechism, were asked if it were
permitted to pray to images, the child would answer,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘No, by no means; for they have no life nor sense
to help us;’</span> and the pastor who discovered any one
rendering any portion of the respect which belongs
to God alone to a crucifix or to a picture, would
have no hesitation in breaking the one and tearing
the other into shreds, and throwing the fragments
into the flames, in imitation of Ezechias, who broke
the brazen serpent on account of the superstitious
reverence which the Israelites manifested towards
it.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierurgia</span></span>,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is perfectly true that the Council of Trent has
declared that the images of Christ, of the virgin,
and of other saints, are to be honoured and venerated,
not because it is believed that there is any
divinity or virtue inherent in them, or that any
thing is to be asked of them, or any confidence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
placed in images, as had been done by Pagans,
who put their trust in idols (Psalm cxxxv. 15-18),
but that <span class="tei tei-q">“the honour given should be referred to
those whom they represent, so that by the images
which we kiss, before which we uncover our heads,
or prostrate ourselves (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">procumbimus</span></span>), we
worship Christ and the saints whose likeness those

or virtue resident in images,”</span> as is declared
by the Council of Trent, what is to become of all
those miraculous images which are the subject of
pilgrimage in so many Roman Catholic countries,
and the existence of whose miraculous powers has
been solemnly acknowledged by the highest ecclesiastical
authorities? I shall not attempt to enumerate
those miraculous images, because their number
is legion, but I shall only ask the rev. doctor whether
he considers the image of the virgin of Loretto,
which is the object of so many pilgrimages, and to
which so many miracles are ascribed, as having
some virtue resident in it or not? and would he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
break it in pieces on account of the miraculous
powers ascribed to it? Is he prepared to act in such
a manner with the celebrated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bambino</span></span><a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> of
Rome? and are the miraculous powers ascribed to
it, as well as to the virgin of Loretto, and other
images of this kind, a reality or an imposture? and,
finally, what will he do with the winking Madonna of
Rimini, which has lately made so much noise, and
which, instead of being broken to pieces or torn to
shreds by the priests or the bishop of the place, has
been approved by ecclesiastical authority? I can
assure the rev. doctor, that by breaking into pieces
the miraculous images, carved as well as painted, he
will break down many barriers which now separate
the Protestant Christians from those who belong to
his own church. I am, however, afraid that he will
find many difficulties in attempting such a thing;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and I must remind him, that in quoting the above-mentioned
canon of the Council of Trent, he forgot
an essential part of it, which greatly modifies the
declaration that there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no divinity or virtue resident
in images</span></em>, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“That the holy synod ordains
that no one be allowed to place, or cause to
be placed, any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unusual</span></em> image<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> in any place or
church, howsoever exempted, except that the image
be approved by the bishop: also, that no new miracles
are to be acknowledged or new relics recognised,
unless the said bishop has taken cognizance and approved
thereof, who, as soon as he has obtained certain
information in regard to these matters, shall,
after having taken the advice of theologians and of
other pious men, act therein as he shall judge to be
consonant with truth and piety.”</span>—(Sess. xxviii., &amp;c.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The real meaning of the above-mentioned canon
of the Council of Trent is therefore, I think, that
there is no divinity or virtue resident in the images
which are not authorised by the bishop to work
miracles, and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unlicensed</span></em> images are not allowed
to have any such divinity or virtue in them, but that
such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unusual</span></em> carved or painted images, as those
which I have mentioned above, having obtained the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cannot be accused of violent opinions, the learned

to address statues or bones, and to suppose that
either the Divinity or the saints were attached to a
certain place or to a certain statue more than to other
places; and that there was no difference between the
prayers which are addressed to the Virgin of Aix la
Chapelle, or to that of Ratisbon, and the Pagan invocations
of the Ephesian Diana, or the Platean
Juno, or any other statue.”</span><a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> To these observations

There is scarcely any ceremony in the Western as
well as in the Eastern church, the origin of which
cannot be traced to the Pagan worship. I shall
limit my observations on this subject to the three
following objects, which constitute the most important
elements in the divine service performed
in those churches, namely,—1. The consecrated
water; 2. Lamps and candles; and, 3. Incense; giving
the Roman Catholic explanation of their origin,
as well as that which I believe to be true.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to the consecrated water, it is described
by the author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hierurgia”</span> in the following
manner:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The ordinance of Almighty God, promulgated
by the lips of Moses, concerning the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">water of separation</span></em>,
and the mode of sprinkling it, are minutely
noticed in the nineteenth chapter of the book of
Numbers. In the book of Exodus, we read that the
Lord issued the following declarations to Moses:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou
shalt make a brazen laver, with its foot, to
wash in; and thou shalt set it between the tabernacle
of the testimony and the altar. And the water
being put into it, Aaron and his sons shall wash their
hands and feet in it when they are going into the
tabernacle of the testimony, and when they are to
come to the altar to offer incense on it to the Lord.’</span>—(Exod.
xxx. 18-20.)</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That it was a practice with the Jews, not only
peculiar to the members of the priesthood, but observed
amongst the people, for each individual to
wash his hands before he presumed to pray, is a well-attested
fact. The church adopted this as well as
several other Jewish ceremonies, which she engrafted
on her ritual; and St Paul apparently borrows from
such ablution the metaphor which he employs while
thus admonishing his disciple Timothy:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘I will
that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands.’</span>—(1
Timothy ii. 8.) That in the early ages the
faithful used to wash their hands at the threshold of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the church before they entered, is expressly mentioned
by a number of writers.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the use of holy water being of apostolic
origin, he says:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The introduction of holy or blessed water must be
referred to the times of the apostles. That it was
the custom, in the very first ages of the church, not
only to deposit vessels of water at the entrance of
those places where the Christians assembled for the
celebration of divine worship, but also to have vases
containing water mingled with salt, both of which
had been separated from common use, and blessed by
the prayers and invocations of the priest, is certain.
A particular mention of it is made in the constitution
of the apostles; and the pontiff Alexander, the
first of that name, but the sixth in succession from
St Peter, whose chair he mounted in the year 109,
issued a decree by which the use of holy water was
permitted to the faithful in their houses.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierurgia</span></span>,
pp. 461-463.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is rather a strange thing for Christians to imitate
the religious rites of the Jews, whose ceremonial
law,—<span class="tei tei-q">“which stood only in meats and drinks, and
divers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">washings</span></em>, and carnal ordinances, imposed on
them until the time of reformation”</span> (Heb. ix. 10),—was
abolished by the New Testament. However, if
this is to be done, why is not the holy water adopted
by the Roman Catholic Church prepared in the same
manner, and used for the same object, as the Jewish
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">water of separation</span></em>, described in Numbers xix., but,
on the contrary, composed in the same manner, and
employed for the same purpose, as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lustral</span></em> water
of the Pagans? The fact is, that it has been
borrowed from the Pagan worship and not from
the Jewish ceremonial law, the truth of which is
honestly acknowledged by the Jesuit La Cerda,
who, in a note on the following passage of
Virgil,—

The same custom was
observed in the Pagan temples, at the entrance of
which there was a vase containing the holy or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lustral</span></span>
water, for the people to sprinkle themselves with,
just as is now done at the entrance of the Roman
Catholic churches. The author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hierurgia”</span>
mentions, as quoted above, that Pope Alexander I.
authorised, in the beginning of the second century,
the use of holy water; and yet Justin Martyr,
who wrote about that time, says <span class="tei tei-q">“that it was invented

And the Emperor Julian, in order to vex the Christians,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
caused the victuals in the markets to be

starving them or compelling them to eat what they
considered as impure.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To these evidences of the abomination in which
the primitive Christians held the Pagan rite of
sprinkling with holy water, I may add the following
anecdote, characteristic of the intensity of this
feeling:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Julian the Apostate was one day going to
sacrifice in the temple of Fortune, accompanied by
the usual train of the emperors, the Pagan priests,
standing on both sides of the temple gate, sprinkled
those who were entering it with the lustral or holy
water in order to purify them according to the rites
of their worship. A Christian tribune, or superior
officer of the imperial guards (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">scutarii</span></span>), who, being
on duty, preceded the monarch, received some drops
of this holy water on his <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">chlamys</span></span> or coat, which
made him so indignant, that, notwithstanding the
presence of the emperor, he struck the priest who
had thus sprinkled him, exclaiming that he did not
purify but pollute him. Julian ordered the arrest of
the officer who had thus insulted the rites of his
religion, giving him the choice either to sacrifice to
the gods or to leave the army. The bold Christian
chose the latter, but was soon restored to his rank on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
account of his great military talents, and raised, after
the death of Julian and the short reign of Jovian, to
the imperial throne as Valentinian I.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This monarch was, however, by no means a bigot;
on the contrary, we have the unsuspected testimony
of the contemporary Pagan writer Ammianus Marcellinus
that he maintained a strict impartiality between
the Christians and Pagans, and did not trouble
any one on account of his religion. He even regulated
and confirmed, by a law in 391, the privileges
of the Pagan clergy in a more favourable
manner than had been done by many of his predecessors;
and yet this monarch, who treated his
Pagan subjects with such an extreme liberality, committed,
when a private individual, an act of violence
against their worship which exposed him to considerable
danger. This, I think, is a strong proof of
the horror which the Christians felt for a rite which
constitutes now an indispensable part of the service
in the Western as well as in the Eastern churches,
and is most profusely used by them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to the candles and lamps, which form a
no less important and indispensable part of the worship
adopted by the above-mentioned churches, the
author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hierurgia”</span> defends their use in the following
manner:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After having described the candlesticks employed
in the Jewish temple, he says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“But without referring
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the ceremonial of the Jewish temple,
we have an authority for the employment of light
in the functions of religion presented to us in the
Apocalypse. In the first chapter of that mystic
book, St John particularly mentions the golden
candlesticks which he beheld in his prophetic vision
in the isle of Patmos. By commentators on the
sacred Scripture, it is generally supposed that the
Evangelist, in his book of the Apocalypse, adopted
the imagery with which he represents his mystic
revelations from the ceremonial observed in his days
by the church for offering up the mass, or eucharistic
sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Christ Jesus.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That the use of lights was adopted by the church,
especially at the celebration of the sacred mysteries,
as early as the times of the apostles, may likewise,
with much probability, be inferred from that passage
in their Acts which records the preaching and miracles
of St Paul at Troas:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘And on the first day
of the week, when we were assembled to break bread,
Paul discoursed with them, being to depart on the
morrow, and he continued his speech until midnight.
And there were a great number of lamps in the upper
chamber where we were assembled.’</span>—(Acts xx. 7, 8.)
That the many lamps, so particularly noticed in this
passage, were not suspended merely for the purpose
of illuminating, during the night-time, this upper
chamber, in which the faithful had assembled on the
first day of the week to break bread, but also to increase
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the solemnity of that function and betoken a
spiritual joy, may be lawfully inferred from every
thing we know about the manners of the ancient
Jews, from whom the church borrowed the use of
lights in celebrating her various rites and
festivals.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierurgia</span></span>,
p. 372.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is really difficult seriously to answer such extraordinary
suppositions as that the seven candlesticks,
expressly mentioned as types of the seven churches,
should be an allusion to the physical lights used in
the worship of those churches, and not to the
moral and spiritual light which they were spreading
amongst Jews and Gentiles. Such an explanation
appears to me nothing better than that tendency
to materialise the most abstract and spiritual ideas
to which I have alluded above, p. <a href="#Pg126" class="tei tei-ref">126</a>. With regard
to the passage in the Acts xx. 7, 8, which says
that there were a great number of lamps in the upper
chamber where St Paul was preaching, I think that
this circumstance might have been considered as a religious
rite if the apostle had been preaching at noon;
but as it is expressly said that he did it at night, nothing
can be more simple than the lighting of the upper
chamber with lamps. It was also very natural that
there should be many of them, because as St Paul was
undoubtedly often referring to the Scriptures, his
hearers, or at least many of them, being either real
Jews or Hellenists, must have been continually looking
to copies of the Bible in order to verify his quotation.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It was, therefore, necessary to have the
room well lighted, and consequently to employ many
lamps. It is, indeed, curious to see to what far-fetched
suppositions a writer of so much learning
and ingenuity as Dr Rock is obliged to recur, in order
to defend a purely Pagan rite which has been adopted
by his church, giving the simplest and clearest things
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-natural sense</span></em>, similar to that which some
Romanising clergymen have been giving to the precepts
of a church which they were betraying whilst
in her service and pay.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same author maintains that lights were
employed from primitive times at divine service,
saying:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The custom of employing lights, in the earlier
ages of the church, during the celebration of the
eucharist; and other religious offices, is authenticated
by those venerable records of primitive discipline
which are usually denominated Apostolic
Canons.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierurgia</span></span>,
p. 393.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, what is the authenticity of these canons?
The author himself gives us the best answer to it,
saying:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Though these canons be apocryphal, and by consequence
not genuine, inasmuch as they were neither
committed to writing by the apostles themselves, nor
penned by St Clement, to whom some authors have
attributed them; still, however, this does not prevent
them from being true and authentic, since they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
embody the traditions descended from the apostles
and the apostolic fathers, and bear a faithful testimony
that the discipline which prevailed during the
first and second centuries was established by the
apostles.”</span>—(P. 394.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall not enter into a discussion about the value
of evidence furnished by a work which is acknowledged
to be apocryphal, and not to have been written
by those to whom its defenders had ascribed its
authorship;<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> but I shall only remark, that one of the
most eminent fathers of the church, the learned Lactantius,
who flourished in the fourth century, and
consequently long after the time when the Apostolic
Canons are supposed to have been composed,
takes a very different view from them in regard to
this practice, because he positively says, in attacking
the use of lights by the Pagans, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they light up candles
to God as if he lived in the dark, and do they not
deserve to pass for madmen who offer lamps to the
Author and Giver of light</span></em>?<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> And is it probable that
he could approve of a practice in the Christian
church which he condemns in the Pagan?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, indeed, can there be any thing more
heathenish than the custom of burning lights
before images or relics, which is nothing else
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than sacrifices which the Pagans offered to their
idols?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have described above, p. <a href="#Pg074" class="tei tei-ref">74</a>, the manner in
which St Jerome defended the use of lights in the
churches against Vigilantius. This defence of St
Jerome is adduced by our author in a rather extraordinary
manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It happens not unfrequently that those very
calumnies which have been propagated, and the
attacks which were so furiously directed by the enemies
of our holy faith in ancient times, against certain
practices of discipline then followed by the
church, are the most triumphant testimonies which
can be adduced at the present day, both to establish
the venerable origin of such observances, and to
warrant a continuation of them. In the present instance,
the remark is strikingly observable; for the
strictures which Vigilantius passed in the fourth age,
on the use of lights in churches, as well as on the
shrines of the martyrs, and the energetic refutation
of St Jerome of the charge of superstition preferred
against such a pious usage by that apostate, may
be noticed as an irrefragable argument, in the nineteenth
century, to establish the remote antiquity of
this religious custom. After mentioning as a fact of
public notoriety, and in a manner which defied contradiction,
that the Christians, at the time when he
was actually writing, which was about the year 376,<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were accustomed to illumine their churches during
mid-day with a profusion of wax tapers, Vigilantius
proceeds to turn such a devotion into ridicule. But
he met with a learned and victorious opponent,
who, while he vindicated this practice of the church
against the objection of her enemy, took occasion to
assign those reasons which induced her to adopt it.
That holy father observes:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Throughout all the
churches of the East, whenever the Gospel is to be
recited, they bring forth lights, though it be at noon-day;
not certainly to shine among darkness, but to
manifest some sign of joy, that under the type of
corporeal light may be indicated that light of which
we read in the Psalms, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy word is a lamp to my
feet, and a light to my path.”</span> ’</span> ”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierurgia</span></span>,
p. 298.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, I would observe to the learned doctor, that
St Jerome, in answering Vigilantius, maintained, as
I have shown above, p. <a href="#Pg074" class="tei tei-ref">74</a>, that it was calumny
to say that the Christians burnt candles in the daylight,
and that it was done only by some people,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whose zeal was without knowledge</span></em>. Consequently,
the church which has adopted this practice shows,
according to the authority of that <span class="tei tei-q">“holy and learned
father,”</span> that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her zeal is without knowledge</span></em>. With
regard to the argument in support of the abovementioned
practices given by St Jerome, and reproduced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by our author, that the Eastern churches
make use of lights, I admit that it is unanswerable,
because it is an undoubted fact that the Græco-Russian
Church makes an immense consumption of
wax candles, chiefly burnt before the images, and it
remains for me only to congratulate the advocates of
this practice on the support which they derive from
such an imperative authority as that of the Græco-Russian
Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It remains for me now only to say a few words
about the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">incense</span></span>, which forms a constituent part of
the service of the Roman Catholic and Græco-Russian
Churches, as much as the holy water and lights, and
which is defended by the author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hierurgia”</span> in
the following manner. After having described the
use of incense in the Jewish temples, he says—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It was from this religious custom of employing
incense in the ancient temple, that the royal
prophet drew that beautiful simile of his, when
he petitioned that his prayers might ascend before
the Lord like incense. It was while <span class="tei tei-q">‘all the
multitude were praying without at the hour of incense,
that there appeared to Zachary an angel of
the Lord, standing at the right of the altar of incense,’</span>—(Luke
i. 10, 11). That the oriental nations
attached a meaning not only of personal reverence,
but also of religious homage to an offering of incense,
is demonstrable from the instance of the
magi, who, having fallen down to adore the newborn
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jesus, and recognise his divinity, presented
him with gold, and myrrh, and frankincense. That
he might be more intelligible to those who read his
book of the Apocalypse, it is very probable that St
John adapted his language to the ceremonial of the
liturgy then followed by the Christians in celebrating
the eucharistic sacrifice, at the period the evangelist
was committing to writing his mysterious revelations.
In depicting, therefore, the scene which
took place in the sanctuary of heaven, where he was
given to behold in vision the mystic sacrifice of the
Lamb, we are warranted to suppose that he borrowed
the imagery, and selected several of his expressions,
from the ritual then actually in use, and has in consequence
bequeathed to us an outline of the ceremonial
which the church employed in the apostolic
ages of offering up the unbloody sacrifice
of the same divine Lamb of God, Christ Jesus, in
her sanctuary upon earth. Now, St John particularly
notices how the <span class="tei tei-q">‘angel came and stood before
the altar, having a golden censer; and there was
given him much incense, that he should offer of the
prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which
is before the throne of God; and the smoke of the
incense of the prayers of the saints ascended up
before God, from the hand of the angel.’</span>—Apocal.
viii. 3-5.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierurgia</span></span>, p. 518.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this explanation of the use of incense in the
churches, I may answer by the same observation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which I have made, p. <a href="#Pg144" class="tei tei-ref">144</a>, on a similar defence of
the use of lights, namely, that it is a strange
materialization of spiritual ideas by embodying into
a tangible shape what is simply typical, and which
is not warranted by any direct evidence. Such far-fetched
and fanciful conjectures cannot be refuted
by serious arguments; but as regards the Jewish
origin of the use of incense, as well as of many other
ceremonies common to the Roman Catholic and
Greek Churches, I shall give the observation of the
celebrated Dr Middleton, on an answer made by a
Roman Catholic to his well-known Letter from
Rome, and who, defending the ceremonies of his
Church in nearly the same manner as the author of
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hierurgia,”</span> says, <span class="tei tei-q">“That Dr Middleton was mistaken
in thinking every ceremony used by the
heathens to be heathenish, since the greatest part of
them were borrowed from the worship of the true
God, in imitation of which the devil affected to
have his temples, altars, priests, and sacrifices,
and all other things which were used in the true
worship.”</span> This he applied to the case of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incense</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lamps</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holy water</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">processions</span></em>, adding, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
if Middleton had been as well read in the Scriptures
as he seemed to be in the heathen poets, he
would have found the use of all these in the temple
of God, and that by God's appointment.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I shall not dispute with him,”</span> says Middleton,
<span class="tei tei-q">“about the origin of these rites, whether they were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first instituted by Moses</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were of prior use and
antiquity amongst the Egyptians</span></em>. The Scriptures
favour the last, which our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spenser</span></span> strongly asserts,
and their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Calmet</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Huetius</span></span> allow; but
should we grant him all that he can infer from his argument,
what will he gain by it? Were not all those
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beggarly elements</span></em> wiped away by the spiritual worship
of the Gospel? Were they not all annulled,
on account of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their weakness and unprofitableness</span></em>,
by the more perfect revelation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ</span></span>?—(Gal.
iv. 9; Heb. vii. 18.) If, then, I should
acknowledge my mistake, and recall my words, and
instead of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pagan</span></span>, call
them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jewish</span></span> ceremonies,
would not the use of Jewish rites be abominable still
in a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian church</span></span>, where they are expressly
abolished and prohibited by God himself?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But to pursue his argument a little farther.
While the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mosaic</span></span> worship subsisted by divine appointment
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerusalem, the devil likewise</span></span>, as he
tells us, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had temples and ceremonies of the same
kind</span></em>, in order to draw votaries to his idolatrous worship,
which, after the abolition of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jewish</span></span> service,
was carried on still with great pomp and splendour,
and above all places, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>, the principal
seat of his worldly empire. Now, it is certain that
in the early times of the Gospel, the Christians of
Rome were celebrated for their zealous adherence to
the faith of Christ, as it was delivered to them by
the apostles, pure from every mixture either of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jewish</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">heathenish
superstition</span></span>, till, after a succession
of ages, as they began gradually to deviate
from that apostolic simplicity, they introduced at
different times into the church the particular ceremonies
in question. Whence, then, can we think it
probable that they should borrow them from the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jewish</span></span> or the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pagan</span></span> ritual? From a temple remote,
despised and demolished by the Romans
themselves, or from temples and altars perpetually
in their view, and subsisting in their streets, in
which their ancestors and fellow-citizens have constantly
worshipped?<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> The question can hardly
admit any dispute; the humour of the people, as
well as the interest of a corrupted priesthood, would
invite them to adopt such rites as were native to the
soil, and found upon the place, and which long
experience had shown to be useful to the acquisition
both of wealth and power. Thus, by the most candid
construction of this author's reasoning, we must
necessarily call their ceremonies <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jewish</span></span>, or by pushing
it to its full length, shall be obliged to call them
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devilish</span></span>.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“He observes that I begin my charge with the use of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incense</span></em> as the most notorious proof of their Paganism,

it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first thing</span></em> that strikes the sense, and surprises
a stranger upon his entrance into their churches.
But it shall be my strongest proof, if he will have it
so, since he has brought nothing, I am sure, to
weaken the force of it. He tells us that there was
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an altar of incense in the temple of Jerusalem</span></em>,
and is surprised, therefore, how I can call it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heathenish</span></em>;
yet it is evident, from the nature of that institution,
that it was never designed to be perpetual,
and that during its continuance, God would have
never approved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any other altar</span></em>, either in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerusalem</span></em>
or any where else. But let him answer directly to
this plain question: Was there ever <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a temple in the
world, not strictly heathenish</span></em>, in which there were
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">several altars, all smoking with incense, within our
view, and at one and the same time</span></em>? It is certain
that he must answer in the negative; yet it is as
certain that there were many such temples in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Pagan</span></em>
Rome, and are as many in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian Rome</span></em>; and
since there never was an example of it, but what was
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Paganish</span></em>, before the time of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Popery</span></em>, how is it possible
that it could be derived to them from any other
source? or when we see so exact a resemblance in

original?</span>

The Græco-Russian Church is perhaps the most
important element of the politico-religious complications
in which Europe is at present involved. It
is, moreover, not a fortuitous cause of these complications,
but has been growing during centuries, until
it has reached its present magnitude, though its
action upon Turkey may have been prematurely
brought into play by accidental circumstances. It
comprehends within its pale about 50,000,000 of
souls, whilst it exercises an immense influence upon
13,000,000 of Turkish, and a considerable one upon
more than 3,000,000 of Austrian subjects, professing
the tenets of that church, though governed by separate
hierarchies. To this number must be added
the population of the kingdom of Greece, amounting
to about 1,000,000: so that the whole of the
followers of the Eastern Church may be computed
in round numbers at 66,000,000 or 67,000,000 of
souls.<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Russian Church differs from other Greek
churches, not in her tenets, but in her government.
From the establishment of Christianity in Russia,
towards the end of the tenth century, to the capture
of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453, the Russian
Church was governed by a metropolitan, consecrated
by the Patriarch of Constantinople. After this
event, the metropolitans were consecrated by the
Russian bishops till 1588, when a patriarch of
Russia was instituted by that of Constantinople,
who had arrived at Moscow, in order to obtain pecuniary
assistance for his church. The patriarch enjoyed
considerable influence, which modified in
some respects the despotic authority of the Czar. It
was Peter the Great who abolished this dignity
in 1702, after the death of the Patriarch Adrian, and
declared himself the head of the Russian Church.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He introduced several regulations to restrict the
power of the clergy, and to improve their education.
It appears that the violent reforms by which that
monarch tried to introduce the civilization of western
Europe amongst his subjects, had produced an
intellectual movement in their church, but which,
not squaring with the views of the imperial reformer,
was violently suppressed by him. Thus, in
1713, a physician called Demetrius Tveritinoff, and
some other persons, began to attack the worship of
images, and to explain the sacrament of communion
in the same sense as has been done by Calvin.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These reformers were anathematised by the order of
the Czar, and one of them was executed in 1714.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>
Next year, 1715, a Russian priest, called Thomas,
probably a disciple of the above-mentioned reformers,
began publicly to inveigh against the worship
of saints and other practices of his church, and
went even so far as to break the images placed in
the churches. He was burnt alive, and nothing
more was heard afterwards of such reformers. The
Russian clergy regained their influence under the
reign of the Empress Elizabeth, 1742-62, a weak-minded,
bigoted woman, who was continually making
pilgrimages to the shrines of various Russian
saints and miraculous images, displaying on those
occasions such a splendour and such munificence to
the objects of her devotion, that the finances of her
state were injured by it.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a> Elizabeth's nephew and
successor, Peter III., Duke of Holstein, who, for
the sake of the throne, had passed from the
Lutheran communion to the Greek Church, entertained
the greatest contempt for his new religion.
This half-crazy, unfortunate prince, instead of trying
to reform the Russian Church by promoting a superior
information amongst her clergy, offended the
religious prejudices of his subjects by an open disregard
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the ordinances of that church, and his projects
of violent reforms. He not only did away with
all the fasts at his court, but he wished to abolish
them throughout all his empire, to remove the
images and candles from the churches, and, finally,
that the clergy should shave their beards and dress
like the Lutheran pastors. He also confiscated the
landed property of the church. Catherine II., who
observed with the greatest diligence those religious
rites which her husband treated with such contempt,
and who greatly owed to this conduct her
elevation to the throne, confirmed, however, the
confiscation of the church estates, assigning salaries
to the clergy and convents who had been supported
by that property. She made use of the influence of
the Græco-Russian Church for the promotion of her
political schemes in Poland and in Turkey; yet, as
her religious opinions were those of the school of Voltaire
and Diderot, which believed that Christianity
would soon cease to have any hold upon the human
mind, she seems not to have been fully aware of that
immense increase of power at home and influence
abroad which a skilful action upon the religious feelings
of the followers of that church may give to the
Russian monarchs. This policy has been formed into a
complete system by the present Emperor, and it was
in consequence of it that several millions of the inhabitants
of the ancient Polish provinces, who belonged
to the Greek United Church, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, who had acknowledged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the supremacy of the Pope by accepting the
union concluded at Florence in 1438, were forced to
give up that union, and to pass from the spiritual
dominion of the Pope to that of the Czar. This
wholesale conversion was necessarily accompanied
with a good deal of persecution. Those clergymen
who had refused to adopt the imperial ukase for
their rule of conscience were banished to Siberia,
and many other acts of oppression were committed
on that occasion, but of which only the case of the
nuns of Minsk has produced a sensation in western
Europe. The same system of religious centralization
has also been applied to the Protestant peasantry of
the Baltic provinces, many of whom were seduced
by various means to join the Russian Church; and
this policy continues to be vigorously prosecuted in
the same quarter, as may be seen by the following
extract from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Berlin Gazette</span></span> of Voss, reprinted
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</span></span> of the 12th March of this
year, 1854:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Emissaries travelling about the country succeeded
by every kind of cunning, and by holding
out prospects of gain and other advantages, to convert
people from Lutheranism to the Greek Church.
All the children, under seventeen years must follow
the religion of their father as soon as he has entered
the orthodox church. Whoever has received the
anointment<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> can no longer return to his former

creed, and those who would try to persuade him to
do it would be severely punished. It is even forbidden
to the Protestant clergy to warn their congregations
from going over to the Greek Church by
drawing their attention to the difference which exists
between the two religions. A great number of
Greek churches have been built in the Baltic provinces,
and already, in 1845, it was ordered that the
converts to the Greek Church should be admitted
into every town; that those peasants who would
leave their places of residence in order to join a
Greek congregation should be allowed by their landowners
to do so;<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> and, finally, that the landowners
and Protestant clergymen who would oppose in any
way the conversion to the Greek Church of their
peasantry and congregations, should be visited with
severe penalties. These penalties, directed against
those who would attempt to induce any one, either
by speeches or writings, to pass from the Greek
Church to any other communion, have been specified
in a new criminal code. They prescribe for certain
cases of such a proselytism corporal chastisement,
the knout, and transportation to Siberia.”</span> It is also
well known that the Protestant missionaries, who had
been labouring in various parts of the Russian empire
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the conversion of Mahometans and heathens,
have been prohibited from continuing their pious exertions.
And yet, strange to say, there is a not uninfluential
party in Prussia, which, pretending to be
zealously Protestant, supports with all its might the
politico-religious policy of Russia, and is as hostile
to Protestant England as it is favourable to the power
which is persecuting Protestantism in its dominions.
On the other hand, it is curious to observe in this
country some persons of that High Church party
which affects to repudiate the name of Protestant,
and with whom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">churchianity</span></span> seems to have more
weight than Christianity, showing an inclination to
unite with the Græco-Russian Church; and I have
seen a pamphlet, ascribed to a clergyman of the
Scotch Episcopal Church, positively recommending
such a union, and containing the formulary of a petition
to be addressed by the Episcopalians of Great Britain
to the most holy Synod of St Petersburg, praying
for admission into the communion of its church. I
would, however, observe to these exaggerated Anglo-catholics,
who chiefly object to the ecclesiastical establishment
of England on account of its being a
State Church, that the Russian Church is still more
so, and that the most holy synod which administers
that church, though composed of prelates and
other clergymen, can do nothing without the assent
of its lay member, the imperial procurator, and that
a colonel of hussars was lately intrusted with this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
important function. The Greek Church being opposed
to Rome, some Protestants sought to conclude
a union with her in the sixteenth century; and the
Lutheran divines of Tubingen had for this purpose a
correspondence with the Patriarch of Constantinople,
between the years 1575 and 1581, but which did not
lead to any result, as the Patriarch insisted upon their
simply joining his church. The Protestants of Poland
attempted in 1599 a union with the Greek
Church of their country, and the delegates of both
parties met for this purpose at Vilna; their object
was, however, frustrated by the same cause which
rendered nugatory the efforts that had been made
by the divines of Tubingen for this purpose, the
Greek Church insisting upon their entire submission
to her authority. It is true that some learned ecclesiastics
of the Græco-Russian Church are supposed
to entertain Protestant opinions, but this is entirely
personal, and has no influence whatever on the systematic
policy of their Church, which hates Rome
as a rival, but Protestantism as a revolutionary
principle. One of the ablest and most zealous defenders
of the Roman Catholic Church in our times,
and whom a long residence in Russia had made
thoroughly acquainted with her church, Count Joseph
Demaistre, is of opinion that this church must finally
give way to the influence of Protestantism;<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> and I
think that this might be really the case if the Russian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Church enjoyed perfect liberty of discussion,
which she is very far at present from possessing.
I believe, however, that such a contingency is very
possible with those Eastern churches that are not
under the dominion of Russia, if they were once
entirely liberated from Russian influence and brought
into contact with Protestant learning. Such a revolution
would be most dangerous, not only to the external
influence of Russia, but even to her despotism
at home, because a Protestant movement amongst
the Greek churches of Turkey would sever every
connection between them and Russia, and very
likely extend to the last-named country. It is therefore
most probable, as has been observed by the
celebrated explorer of Nineveh, Layard, that the
movement alluded to above, which has recently
begun to spread amongst the Armenian churches of
Turkey, was not without influence on the mission of
Prince Menschikoff and its consequences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have said above that the mutual position of the
Græco-Russian and Roman Catholic Churches towards
one another is that of two rivals. The dogmatic difference
between them turns upon some abstruse
tenets, which are generally little understood by the
great mass of their followers, whilst the essential
ground of divergence, the real question at issue, is,
whether the headship of the church is to be vested
in the Pope, in the Patriarch of Constantinople, or
in the Czar. The Pope has allowed that portion of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Greek Church which submitted to his supremacy
at the council of Florence in 1438, to retain its ritual
and discipline, with some insignificant modifications.
The Roman Catholic Church considers the Græco-Russian
one in about the same light as she is regarded
herself by that of England. She acknowledges
her to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a church</span></em>, though a schismatic one,
whose sacraments and ordination are valid, so that
a Greek or Russian priest becomes, on signing the
union of Florence, a clergyman of the Roman Catholic
Church exactly as is the case in the Anglican
Church with a Roman Catholic priest who renounces
the pope. The Græco-Russian Church does not,
however, return the compliment to the Roman
Catholic one, any more than the Catholic does it to
that of England; because a Roman Catholic priest
who enters the Græco-Russian Church not only loses
his sacerdotal character, just as is the case with an
Anglican clergyman who goes over to the communion
of Rome, but he must be even baptised
anew, as is done with Christians of every denomination
who join that church, whether Jews or
Gentiles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The system of reaction which the Roman Catholic
Church has been pursuing for many years, with a
consistency, perseverance, and zeal worthy of a better
cause, and not without considerable success, has created
just alarm in the minds of many friends of religious
and civil liberty. This feeling is but too well warranted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the open hostility which the promoters of
that reaction, having thrown away the mask of
liberalism, are manifesting to the above-mentioned
liberties. I shall, moreover, add, that the political
complications in which Europe is now involved may
be taken advantage of by the reactionary party in
order to advance its schemes, whilst the public attention,
particularly of this country, will be absorbed by
the events of the present war; and therefore I think
that all true Protestants should, instead of relaxing,
increase their vigilance, in respect to the movements
of the ecclesiastical reactionists. But the dangers
which threaten from that quarter are, at least in
this country, of a purely moral character, though they
are doing much mischief in families, and may throw
some obstruction into the legislative action of the
government. They must therefore be combated with
moral and intellectual means,—with spiritual, and
not carnal weapons,—and they may be completely
annihilated by a vigorous and skilful application of
such means. The Pope of Rome, though claiming
a spiritual authority over many countries, cannot
maintain himself in his own temporal dominion
without the assistance of foreign powers, and is
obliged to court the favour of secular potentates, instead
of commanding them, as had been done by
his predecessors. The case is quite different with
the Imperial Pope of Russia, who commands a million
of bayonets, and whose authority is supported,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not by canon, but by cannon law, and not by bulls,
but by bullets. The material force which he has at
his disposal is immensely strengthened by his
spiritual authority over the ignorant masses of the
Russian population, upon whose religious feelings he
may act with great facility, because his orders to the
clergy are as blindly obeyed as his commands to the
army; and it is with the object of extending and consolidating
this authority over all his subjects without
exception that those measures of persecution and seduction
against the Roman Catholics and Protestants,
which I have mentioned above, have been adopted.
The probable consequence of this religious centralization,
and the condition of the church whose exclusive
dominion it is sought to establish in Russia, have been
sketched in the following graphic manner by an accomplished
German writer, who, having resided many
years in Russia, and being thoroughly acquainted
with the language of that country, may be considered
as one of the most competent judges on this subject:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He who, with attentive ear and eye, travels
through the wide empire of the Czar, surrounding
three parts of the world with its snares, and then
traces the sum of his contemplations, will tremble in
thought at the destiny which the Colossus of nations
has yet to fulfil. He who doubts of the impending
fulfilment of this destiny knows not history, and
knows not Russia.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“However different in origin and interest the
strangely mixed hordes may be which constitute this

them all together,—the Byzantine Church. Whoever
remains out of it will soon be forced into it; and

Russia will be of one faith.</span>

lost like drops in the ocean. What a marvellous
disposition of things, that the Russian empire, whose
governing principle is the diametrically opposite of
the Christian law, should be the very one to make
of Christianity the corner, the keystone of its might!
And a no less marvellous disposition of things is it
that the Czar, in whatever direction he stretches his
far-grasping arms, should find Christian points of
support whereon to knit the threads of fate for the

This description of the religious state of the Russian
people, given by a writer who is not very partial
to their country, may be perhaps suspected of
exaggeration, or considered as being too much of a
caricature; I shall therefore give my readers the observations
which have been made on the same subject
by another German author, Baron Haxthausen,
a great admirer of Russia, who travelled over that
country in 1843, under the patronage of the Emperor,
in order to study the state of its agriculture
and industry, as well as the social condition of the
working-classes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A foreigner is struck,”</span> says the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the
deep devotion and the strict observance of the ordinances
and customs of the church shown by Russians
of rank and superior education. I had already,
at Moscow, an opportunity of seeing it. Prince T.,
a young, elegant Muscovite dandy, conducted me
about the churches of the Kremlin, and almost in
every one of them he knelt down before some particularly
venerated object,—as the coffin of a saint,
the image of a Madonna,—and touched the ground
with his forehead, and devoutly kissed the object in
question. I observed the same thing at Yaroslaf.
Madame Bariatynski (the wife of the governor) and
another lady conducted me about the churches of
that city, and as soon as we entered one of them,
both these ladies approached an image of the Virgin,
fell down before it, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without any regard to their
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
dresses</span></em>, touched with their foreheads the ground, and
kissed the image, making signs of the cross; and
these were ladies belonging to the highest society,
and of the most refined manners. Madame Bariatynski
had been a lady of the court, and the ornament
of the first drawing-rooms of St Petersburg.
Her mind is uncommonly cultivated, and she has a
thorough knowledge of French and German literature;
and, indeed, when we were walking to see
these churches, along the banks of the Volga, she
discussed, in an animated and ingenious manner, the
matchless beauty of Goethe's songs, and recited from
memory his Fisherman. Even in the strictest Roman
Catholic countries, as, for instance, Bavaria, Belgium,
Rome, Munster, such public demonstrations of
piety are not to be met, except in some exceedingly
rare cases, with women, but never with men. The
educated classes have in this respect separated from
the lower ones. Even people who are very devout
consider such excessive manifestations of piety as not
quite decent, nay, though they dare not confess it,
they are in some measure ashamed of them. In
Russia the case is different. There are perhaps as
many freethinkers, and even atheists, as in western
Europe, but even they submit, at least in public, and
when they are in their own country, unconditionally,
and almost involuntarily, to the customs of their
church. In this respect, no difference whatever may
be observed between the highest and the commonest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is almost superfluous to observe that a church
which has such a hold on the national mind of Russia
must be a powerful engine in the hands of her
Imperial Pope, whose political authority is thus immensely
strengthened by the influence of religion.
But I think it will be, perhaps, not uninteresting to
my readers to compare this baptised idolatry of the
modern Russians with that which had been practised
by their unbaptised ancestors about a thousand years
ago, and the following account of which is given by
Ibn Foslan, an Arabian traveller of the tenth century,
who saw Russian merchants in the country
of the Bulgars, a Mahometan nation who lived
on the banks of the Volga, and the ruins of whose
capital may be seen not far from the town of
Kazan:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“As soon as their (Russian) vessels arrive at the
anchoring place, every one of them goes on shore,
taking with him bread, meat, milk, onions, and intoxicating
liquors, and repairs to a high wooden
post, which has the likeness of a human face carved
upon it, standing surrounded with small statues of
a similar description, and some high ones erected
behind it. He prostrates himself before this
wooden figure, and says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘O Lord, I have arrived
from a distant country; I have brought with me so

and when he has enumerated all his merchandise,
he lays before the idol the things which he has
brought with him, and continues his prayer, saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Here is a present which I have brought thee, and
I wish thou wouldst send me a customer who has
plenty of gold and silver, who will not bargain with
me, but purchase all that I have to sell at my own
price.’</span> When his commerce does not prosper, he
brings new presents to the idol, and when he meets
with some new difficulties he makes gifts also to the
small statues, but when he is successful he offers
oxen and sheep.”</span><a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>

Kissing constitutes the principal part of the
Russian worship of images and relics, and is most
liberally bestowed on those objects of adoration,
whilst I believe that the Roman Catholic Madonnas
maintain a more dignified state, and do not allow
such familiarities to their worshippers, unless on some
particular occasions or to some privileged persons.
The Emperor himself sets the example of this pious
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">osculation</span></em>, a striking instance of which occurred in
the summer of last year, 1853, under circumstances
which deserve a particular notice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have said above, p. <a href="#Pg161" class="tei tei-ref">161</a>, that several millions
of the followers of the Greek United Church had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been forced by the present emperor to transfer their
spiritual allegiance from the Pope to himself.
Several of their churches contain miraculous images
of the Virgin, of more or less repute, and which
were obliged to share the fate of their worshippers,
and to become schismatics as much as the latter.
Their vested rights have not been, however, injured
in any way by this revolution, because they continue
to be worshipped, and to work miracles as
they did before, or, what is the same thing, they
are fully authorised to do so. The Russian government
followed on this occasion its usual line of
policy, which is to promote those who have joined
it, forsaking their former party; and thus one of the
most distinguished of these miracle-working converts,
the Madonna of Pochayoff, a little town in
Wolhynia, was transferred from her provincial station
to Warsaw, and placed there in a newly built
Russian cathedral, probably with the object of inducing
the Roman Catholic inhabitants of that capital
to imitate an example set to them in such a
high quarter, and to acknowledge the spiritual authority
of the Czar as much as they are obliged to
submit to his temporal dominion. When the emperor
was going last year to Olmutz, in order to persuade
the Austrian court to support his policy in
Turkey, he passed through Warsaw, and repairing,
immediately after his arrival in that city, to the
Russian cathedral, kissed the above-mentioned miraculous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
image of the Madonna of Pochayoff with such
fervour that it produced quite a sensation upon all
those who were present, and was noticed in the
newspapers as a proof of the autocrat's piety. Yet
whether this Madonna, notwithstanding her outward
conversion to the Græco-Russian Church, remains a
Romanist at heart, or whether, for some other reason,
she could or would not support the views of her
imperial worshipper, the result of the Czar's voyage
to Olmutz proved that the caresses which he had
bestowed upon the Madonna in question were
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">love's labours lost</span></span>. It may be also observed, that
the emperor himself seems not to have been quite
sure of the effects of his pious addresses to the now
schismatic Madonna of Pochayoff, because it is well
known that this man, who, as I have said above, p.
161, had torn from the spiritual authority of the
Pope, by a violent persecution, many millions of
souls, knelt during his visit to Olmutz, with all
the marks of deep devotion, at a Roman Catholic
high mass; whilst the Prince of Prussia, who was
also present on that occasion, stood by without taking
a hypocritical part in a worship which was contrary
to his religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This image-kissing propensity of the Russians was
the cause of a tragical event during the plague
at Moscow in 1771. It usually happens during a
public calamity that rumours of a wild and absurd
nature are circulated amongst the ignorant part of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the population, and it was thus that, when the pestilence
was raging in the above-mentioned capital, a
report was spread that an image of the Virgin, placed
at the entrance of a church, had the power of preventing
infection. Thousands of people repaired to
the miraculous image, and endless processions were
wending along the streets towards the same object of
adoration, which was overloaded with rich offerings
by its worshippers, and adorned with costly jewels.
As was to be expected, this superstitious practice,
instead of preventing the infection, powerfully contributed
to its increase; because the kisses which
the crowd lavishly bestowed on the miraculous image
could not but propagate the disease. The Archbishop
of Moscow, Ambrose, an enlightened prelate,
in order to stop this mischief, removed the
image from the place where it had been exposed into
the interior of the church; but this wise measure
produced a violent riot, and an infuriated mob rushed
into the sanctuary and murdered the venerable old
man at the foot of the altar, where he was officiating,
dressed in his pontificals.

It is probably the same image of which Bodenstedt,
whose account of the Russian Church I have quoted
above, p. <a href="#Pg169" class="tei tei-ref">169</a>, relates the following anecdote. After
having spoken of the usurpations of Russia beyond
the Caucasus, under pretence of protecting the Christian
population of those parts, he says:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
claws under the cloak of religion, may be not inaptly
compared to a lady well known at Moscow, who,
to the great edification of the bystanders, kissed the
miraculous Madonna, situated close to the Kremlin,
with so much fervour, that the most costly diamond
of the jewels with which this image is covered remained
in her mouth.”</span> And he adds, in a note,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The thing was afterwards discovered, and the writer
of this was himself present when this lady, the wife
of a Russian general, was obliged publicly to crave
the forgiveness of the image for this act of desecration.
It is said that when this noble lady was judicially
examined about this affair, she pleaded in
her defence that having loved and worshipped the
image in question devoutly during many years,
she believed herself entitled to a little <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">souvenir</span></em>
from the Madonna.”</span><a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> The Russian lady of rank
seems not to have been so ingenious as the Prussian
soldier, whose story I have related on p. <a href="#Pg118" class="tei tei-ref">118</a>. And
it must be remarked that the Russian images expose
their worshippers to the temptations of mammon
much more than the Roman Catholic ones; because,
whilst the latter are often valuable as objects of art,
the former have usually silver or golden garments,
often set with precious stones, which entirely cover
the painting except the face, generally by no means
a model of beauty. The gifts which the Russians
bestow on their images are immense, and the most

says that the value of sacred vases and ornaments
accumulated in that place surpasses all that may be
seen of this kind any where else, without even excepting
Rome and Loretto; and he thinks that the
quantity of pearls contained in those ornaments is
perhaps greater than is to be found in the whole of
Europe.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>

The grave of St Sergius, the founder of that convent
in the fourteenth century, is adorned with gold
and precious stones, and the silver canopy over it is
said to weigh 1200 pounds. The most remarkable
object contained in that convent is, however, the
image of that saint which accompanied Peter the
Great during all his campaigns, and on which are inscribed
the names of all the battles and stormings of
towns at which it had been present. I do not know
whether this image had a part in other expeditions
of the Russian army, but I have read this year in the
newspapers that when a division of grenadiers was
passing through Moscow, on their way to Turkey,
the Archbishop of that capital addressed them, firing
their zeal for the religious war in which they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were going to take part, and after having blessed
them with the image of St Sergius, the same to
which I alluded above, gave it them as a companion
of their expedition. The allied troops must therefore
be prepared to encounter that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bellicose</span></em> saint
somewhere on the Danube, unless he has been ordered
to the shores of the Baltic for the defence
of the capital. The custom of taking with them
images considered as miraculous, during a campaign,
was followed by the generals of the Greek empire on
many occasions. Thus it is related by a Byzantine
writer,<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> that in 590 Philippicus, a general of the Emperor
Mauritius, when going to engage the Persians
in battle, took an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">image which was not made by
the hands of man</span></em>, and carried it about the ranks of
his army, in order to purify his soldiers, and that he
gained, after this ceremony, a complete victory. It
must, however, be remarked that when Philippicus
was replaced by another general, called Priscus, the
latter, relying too much on the protection of the
image which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was not made by the hands of man</span></em>, diminished
the rations of the soldiers, and gave them
other causes of offence; they revolted, and when
Priscus, in order to subdue the riot, paraded the
image in question, the mutineers threw stones at it.
I don't know exactly how this business ended, but it
is said that the Greek generals usually liked to have
an image of the kind alluded to, in order to appease
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their troops in cases of mutiny and discontent; and
I believe that, considering the gross ignorance and
superstition of the Russian soldiers, the image of St
Sergius may do good service in similar cases, and for
which these soldiers have but too many reasons.
The Greek emperors also sometimes provided with
miraculous images the ambassadors who were sent
on important missions. I don't know whether the
Russian diplomacy, which has performed so many
wonders, has ever had recourse to the assistance
of such images, or to that of any supernatural
agency.

The miraculous images of the Græco-Russian
Church are generally considered as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not made by the
hands of man</span></em>, whilst those of the Roman Catholic
Church are usually believed to be painted by St
Luke. The most celebrated Madonnas of Russia,
as those of Kazan, Korennaya, Akhtyrka, &amp;c., are
believed to have dropt from heaven, in the same
manner as the Diana of Ephesus, and other Greek
idols of repute. They are called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">yavlenneeye icony</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, revealed images, and their number is considerable,
though all of them do not enjoy an equal reputation
for miraculous powers. The number of images
of various descriptions is, I think, much greater in
Russia than in any other country, and they are
called by the common people, not images, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">icony</span></span>,
but gods, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">boghi</span></span>; and many of their worshippers are
so ignorant, that they take every kind of picture or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
engraving for the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">boghi</span></span>, and devoutly cross themselves
before them. A German officer of engineers,
in the Russian service, related to the author that
he had a Russian servant, a young lad of a very devout
disposition, who pasted every engraving which
he could lay hold on, upon the wall over his bed, in
order to address his prayers to them. This officer
once missed some plates, containing mathematical
figures, which had dropt from a book of geometry,
and he found afterwards that his pious servant, having
picked them up, gave them a place in his pantheon.
If this strange divinity had been found
amongst the objects worshipped by that poor lad by
some very profound foreign traveller, unacquainted
with the Russian people, it is more than probable
that he would have taken it for a mystical object of
adoration, and written a learned dissertation to explain
its emblematic sense.

Every household in Russia has its own little
sanctuary, consisting of one or more images, ornamented
according to the means of the owner, and
placed in a corner opposite to the principal door.
Every one who enters the room makes a sign of the

them stuck on the wall near his sleeping place, for
his especial use and comfort; whilst people who are
continually moving about, as carriers, pedlars, soldiers,
&amp;c., have their pocket divinities with them; and
the description of the devotional exercises of a Russian
soldier, given on p. <a href="#Pg171" class="tei tei-ref">171</a>, is by no means a

Contemporary travellers relate that people
brought into the churches their own images, trying
to get for them on the walls of the church the
place which they considered the best; and thus it
often happened that these images, being placed
opposite to the altar, people in praying to them
turned their backs to the officiating priest, which
generally produced great confusion, and disturbed
the performance of divine service. There was a
very great competition amongst those people in ornamenting
their images as showily as possible; and
as the sanctity of an image was increased, according
to the opinion of those baptised idolaters, in proportion
to the richness of its ornaments, it often happened
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that a poor man, who could not afford to
trim up smartly his own image, addressed his
prayers to that of his richer neighbour. Such an
adoration, however, was considered as contraband;
and when the lawful owner of the image caught one
of those pious interlopers, he not only sharply rebuked
him, but frequently gave him a sound
thrashing, saying that he did not go to the expense
of decorating his image that another should obtain
its favours.<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>

Scandalous scenes of this description have been
abolished in the established church by the reforms
of the Patriarch Nicon, alluded to above, but something
very like it may still be witnessed in the churches
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Raskolniks</span></span>, who have separated from the established
church on account of those reforms. These
people often bring their own images to the churches
to pray before them, and it frequently happens
amongst the boys who worship in this way, that some
of them, perceiving that their neighbour has a finer
image than their own, they steal it from him, substituting
that which belongs to them. This produces
quarrels and fighting amongst these boys, who reproach
one another, saying, You So-and-so, you have
stolen my fine image which cost my father two
roubles, and left me this wretched one, which is not
worth fifty copecs, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, half a rouble. These scenes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would be ludicrous if they were not positively blasphemous,

It has been observed by some travellers in Russia
that the image-dealers of that country do not sell
their wares, but, by a kind of legal fiction, exchange
them for a certain sum, and that consequently they
are disposed of at a fixed price. This is, however,
not the case, and the image-dealers of Russia make
no exception to the other merchants of that country,
who generally ask for their goods the treble of their
value, and a reasonable price can only be obtained
by hard bargaining. Only consecrated images, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
those which have been sprinkled by a priest with
holy water, cannot be, I think, made an object of
traffic.

The orthodox Russians have no less veneration
for fine churches than for splendidly adorned images,
and the well-known German dramatic writer Kotzebue
gives in the relation of his forced voyage to
Siberia,<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> under the Emperor Paul, a characteristic
trait of this disposition. The titulary counsellor<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a>
Shchekatikhin, who conducted him to the place of
his exile, Kurghan, in the south of Siberia, showed
a great reverence to all the churches which they
passed by. Whenever they passed a fine church
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
constructed of solid masonry, he doffed his cap and
crossed himself most fervently, whilst he treated very
cavalierly all those which were built of wood, making
a hardly perceptible sign of the cross in their
honour. This national propensity to treat respectfully
the great and disdainfully the little, of which
M. Shchekatikhin's piety was such a characteristic
exemplification, has been, in its application to
churches, described by the great admirer of Russia,
Baron Haxthausen, whose account of the devotional
practices observed by the upper classes of that country
I have given above, p. <a href="#Pg173" class="tei tei-ref">173</a>, in the following
manner:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We saw, in most part of the villages on our
road, fine new churches built of stone or brick; but
in one of them, called Novaya, I saw for the first
time an old wooden church, built of logs, and covered
with boards and shingles, such as they generally had
been every where in Russia. These wooden churches
continually disappear, being replaced by those constructed
of masonry. The Russian peasantry consider
it a particular honour to have in their village
a church of stone or brick. To leave a village with
a church of stone in order to settle in a place
which has but a wooden one, is considered as a degradation,
and the inhabitants of the former would
hardly intermarry with those of the latter. The
villages which have only a wooden church, therefore,
do all that they can in order to rise to an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
equal grade with those who have one of stone or brick.
This shows how the pride of rank pervades the
mind of the Russians in every form of life, and in
every class of the population. In cases of this kind,
no promotion but only a sum of money is required
in order to obtain the desired rank. It may be purchased
by constructing a church of stone or brick.
Such a church costs ten, twenty, or thirty thousand
silver roubles (six roubles equal to one pound); but
nothing is more easy than to get this sum. A dozen
of stout fellows disperse in various directions, to collect
by begging the sum required for the construction
of the projected church, which is done without any
expense, as the collectors are hospitably received in
every house. As soon as the necessary sum is obtained,
the village petitions the government for a plan
and for an architect, because the plan of every such
church must be approved at St Petersburg. Thus,
in a few years, a fine church is built, constructed
in the modern style, and the rank of the village
rises in its own and in its neighbours' opinion.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Such things cannot be done in Western Europe,
partly because an active religious feeling amongst the
people disappears more and more,<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> and partly on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
account of the great fluctuation of their ideas, and
want of stability in their opinions. With the Russian
it is quite otherwise. This nation has no political
ideas: but two sentiments pervade its whole being—a
common feeling of nationality, and a fervent attachment
to the national church. Whenever these two
feelings take hold of the Russian's mind, he is ready
willingly to sacrifice without a moment's hesitation
his life and property.”</span><a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is these two national feelings that the Emperor
Nicholas is now trying to excite to the utmost pitch,
and there can be little doubt that if he succeeds in
his object there will be a hard struggle between barbarity
and civilization, though the final triumph of
the latter, to the advantage not only of the victors,
but also of the vanquished, cannot be doubted for a
moment. I must, however, return to Baron Haxthausen,
who continues his account of the Russian
village churches, saying,—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It must not be forgotten, in order to understand
how such large collections for a church of some obscure
village, and made for the most part amongst
the peasants, are obtained, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">giving</span></em> is as much
in the Russian character as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">taking</span></em>. Nowhere property
hangs upon such loose threads and changes
hands with such rapidity as in Russia. To-day rich,
to-morrow poor. People earn and squander away
almost simultaneously; they cheat and are cheated;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they steal with one hand, and give away with the
other. The common Russian sets not his heart on
any kind of property; he loses with perfect equanimity
what he had just earned, in the hope of getting it
again to-morrow.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Russian is, moreover, naturally good-hearted,
charitable, and liberal. A shopkeeper who had perhaps
just cheated his neighbour of the value of 20
copecs, without feeling any qualms of conscience on
the subject, will give one moment after it a rouble
for the construction of a church in some village to
which he is a perfect stranger.”</span><a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, what Cicero said of Catiline, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Sui profusus
alieni cupiens</span></span>, is applicable, not only to individuals,
but also to nations, whose actions are swayed by
feeling without being regulated by principle. It is
almost superfluous to observe that a nation thus disposed,
and with whom superstitious practices have a
greater weight than religious principles, may be easily
precipitated into the most violent and dangerous
courses, which to accomplish seems now to be the
object of the Emperor of Russia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Græco-Russian Church has an immense number
of relics of saints, to which all that Calvin has
said of those of the Roman Catholic Church is applicable.
I have given, in a note to his treatise on this
subject, an account of St Anthony's relics in Russia,
as a counterpart to those which the same saint possesses
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in western Europe. There are, indeed, many
relics to the exclusive possession of which both these
churches lay an equal claim, each of them representing
her own as the only genuine, and that of her
rival as a spurious one. The most celebrated of
these disputed relics is the holy coat of Treves, and
that of Moscow. It is well known what a noise the
former of these produced in 1844, when an immense
number of pilgrims came to worship it; and it is
pretended that it had been found by the Empress
Helena, with the true cross, and presented by her to
the town of Treves. The coat of Moscow was given
as a present to the Czar by a Shah of Persia, and
its genuineness was established by a Russian archbishop,
who asserted that, when he passed through
Georgia on his return from Jerusalem, he saw in a
church of that country a golden box placed upon a
column, and which, as it was told to him, contained
the coat without a seam of our Lord. This statement
was corroborated by an eastern monk, then at
Moscow, who related that it was generally believed
in Palestine, that when the soldiers cast lots for the
possession of that coat, it fell to the part of one of
them, who, being a native of Georgia, took it with
him to his native land. These statements were sufficient
to establish the authenticity of the relic,
which consequently was licensed to work miracles
and worked them.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>

The most celebrated collection of relics in Russia
is found in the town of Kioff, on the Dnieper, and
where the bodies of many hundreds of saints are
deposited in a kind of crypt called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Piechary</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
caverns. The chronicles relate that the digging of
this sacred cavern was commenced in the eleventh
century by two monks called Anthony and Theodosius,
who had come from the Mount Athos, for
their own and their disciples' abode. It was gradually
extended, but the living established themselves
afterwards in a convent above ground, leaving to the
dead the part under it. This statement is considered
to be authentic, but the numerous bodies of the
saints with which the long subterranean galleries of
that cavern are filled, have never been satisfactorily
accounted for. It is the opinion of many, that
the nature of the soil is so dry, that, absorbing
all the moisture, it keeps the dead bodies
which are deposited there in a more or less perfect
state of preservation; and it is said that an
enlightened archbishop of Kioff proved it by a
successful experiment, putting into that place the
bodies of two women, who had been confined as
prisoners in a nunnery for their many vices. Be it
as it may, Kioff is the resort of an immense number
of pilgrims, who arrive from all parts of Russia, to
worship the bodies of the saints, and the riches accumulated
by their pious donations at that place
are only second to those of Troitza (p. 181).

The shrines of Jerusalem, which attract crowds of
pilgrims from all parts of the Christian world, had
been for a long time a subject of dispute between the
Latins and the Greeks, and it is well known that the
politico-religious complications in which Europe is
at present involved have arisen from the claims of
Russia relating to those shrines. It will, therefore, I
think, be not uninteresting to my readers to see the
devout manner in which these shrines are worshipped
by the pilgrims of the Græco-Russian Church;
and I subjoin the two following accounts of this
subject, written at an interval of a century and a
half, in order that my readers may be able to judge
for themselves whether the progress of civilization
during this period has had much influence on the
pilgrims alluded to above.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first of these accounts is an extract from the
diary of an English clergyman, the Rev. Henry
Maundrell, a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and
chaplain to the English factory at Aleppo, who
visited Jerusalem in the year 1697:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saturday, April 3d.</span></span>—We went about mid-day
to see the function of the holy fire. This is a ceremony
kept by the Greeks and Armenians, upon a
persuasion that every Easter Eve there is a miraculous
flame descends from heaven into the Holy Sepulchre,
and kindles all the lamps and candles
there, as the sacrifice was burnt at the prayer of
Elijah.—(1 Kings xviii.)</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Coming to the church of the Holy Sepulchre, we
found it crowded with a numerous and distracted
mob, making a hideous clamour, very unfit for that
sacred place, and better becoming bacchanals than
Christians. Getting, with some struggle, through
this crowd, we went up into the gallery, on that side
of the church next the Latin convent, whence we
could discern all that passed in this religious frenzy.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They began their disorders by running round the
Holy Sepulchre with all their might and swiftness,
crying out as they went, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Huia!</span></span>’</span> which signifies
<span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This is he</span></em>,’</span> or, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This is it</span></em>,’</span> an expression by which
they assert the verity of the Christian religion. After
they had by their vertiginous circulations and clamours
turned their heads, and inflamed their madness,
they began to act the most antic tricks and
postures, in a thousand shapes of distraction. Sometimes
they dragged one another along the floor, all
around the sepulchre; sometimes they set one man
upright on another's shoulders, and in this posture
marched round; sometimes they turned men with
their heels upwards, and hurried them about in such
an indecent manner as to expose their nudities;
sometimes they tumbled round the sepulchre, after
the manner of tumblers on the stage. In a word,
nothing can be imagined more rude or extravagant
than what was acted upon this occasion.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In this tumultuous frantic humour they continued
from twelve to four of the clock, the reason of which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
delay was because of a suit that was then in debate
before the cadi betwixt the Greeks and Armenians,
the former endeavouring to exclude the latter from
having any share in this miracle. Both parties having
expended (as I was informed) five thousand
dollars between them in this foolish controversy, the
cadi at last gave sentence that they should enter the
Holy Sepulchre together, as had been usual at former
times. Sentence being thus given, at four of
the clock both nations went on with their ceremony.
The Greeks first set out in a procession round the
Holy Sepulchre, and immediately at their heels followed
the Armenians. In this order they compassed
the Holy Sepulchre thrice, having produced all their
gallantry of standards, streamers, crucifixes, and embroidered
habits on this occasion.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Toward the end of this procession, there was a
pigeon came fluttering into the cupola over the
sepulchre, at the sight of which there was a greater
shout and clamour than before. This bird, the
Latins told us, was purposely let fly by the Greeks
to deceive the people into an opinion that it was a

<span class="tei tei-q">“The procession being over, the suffragan of the
Greek patriarch (he being himself at Constantinople),
and the principal Armenian bishop, approached to
the door of the sepulchre, and cutting the string with
which it was fastened and sealed, entered in, shutting
the door after them, all the candles and lamps
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
within having been before extinguished in the presence
of the Turks and other witnesses. The exclamations
were doubled as the miracle drew nearer its
accomplishment, and the people pressed with such
vehemence towards the door of the Sepulchre, that it
was not in the power of the Turks set to guard it
with the severest checks to keep them off. The
cause of their pressing in this manner is the great
desire they have to light their candles at the holy
flame, as soon as it is first brought out of the Sepulchre,
it being esteemed the most sacred and
pure, as coming immediately from heaven.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The two miracle-mongers had not been above a
minute in the Holy Sepulchre when the glimmering
of the holy fire was seen, or imagined to appear,
through some chinks of the door, and certainly Bedlam
itself never saw such an unruly transport as was
produced in the mob at this sight. Immediately
after came out the two priests, with blazing torches
in their hands, which they held up at the door of
the Sepulchre, while the people thronged about with
inexpressible ardour, every one striving to obtain a
part of the first and purest flame. The Turks in the
meantime, with huge clubs, laid on them without
mercy; but all this could not repel them, the excess
of their transport making them insensible of pain.
Those that got the fire applied it immediately to
their beards, faces, and bosoms, pretending that it
would not burn like an earthly flame; but I plainly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saw none of them could endure this experiment long
enough to make good that pretension.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“So many hands being employed, you may be sure
it could not be long before innumerable tapers were
lighted. The whole church, galleries and every place,
seemed instantly to be in a flame, and with this illumination
the ceremony ended.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It must be owned that those two within the
sepulchre performed their part with great quickness
and dexterity; but the behaviour of the rabble
without very much discredited the miracle. The
Latins take a great deal of pains to expose this ceremony
as a most shameful imposture, and a scandal
to the Christian religion, perhaps out of envy that
others should be masters of so gainful a business;
but the Greeks and Armenians pin their faith upon
it, and make their pilgrimages chiefly upon this
motive; and it is the deplorable unhappiness of their
priests, that having acted the cheat so long already,
they are forced now to stand to it, for fear of endangering
the apostasy of their people.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Going out of the church after the event was over,
we saw several people gathered about the stone of
unction, who, having got a good store of candles
lighted with the holy fire, were employed in daubing
pieces of linen with the wicks of them and the melting
wax, which pieces of linen were designed for
winding sheets; and it is the opinion of these poor
people that if they can but have the happiness to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Many people may, however, believe that scenes
of such an outrageous description as that witnessed
by Maundrell might have happened in his time, viz.,
1697, but that their repetition is quite impossible
in our own enlightened age. The following account
of the same scenes by Mr Calman, whose veracity is
attested by a high authority, and who had an opportunity
of seeing it only a few years ago, which has
been reproduced in a little, and now particularly
interesting book, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Shrines of the Holy

which the boasted march of intellect has
produced on the Græco-Russian pilgrims, who assemble
every Easter at Jerusalem.

<span class="tei tei-q">“To notice all that was passing,”</span> says Mr Calman,
<span class="tei tei-q">“within the church of the Holy Sepulchre during the
space of twenty-four hours, would be next to impossible,
because it was one continuation of shameless
madness and rioting, which would have been a disgrace
to Greenwich and Smithfield. Only suppose
for a moment the mighty edifice crowded to excess
with fanatic pilgrims of all the Eastern Churches,
who, instead of lifting pure hands to God, without
wrath and quarrelling, are led, by the petty jealousy
about precedency which they should maintain in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
order of their processions, into tumults and fighting,
which can only be quelled by the scourge and whip
of the followers of the false prophet.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Suppose, farther, those thousands of devotees
running from one extreme to the other, from the
extreme of savage irritation to that of savage enjoyment,
of mutual revellings and feastings, like Israel
of old, who, when they made the golden calf, were
eating and drinking, and rising to play. Suppose
troops of men stripped half naked, to facilitate their
actions, running, trotting, jumping, galloping to and
fro, the breadth and length of the church, walking
on their hands with their feet aloft in the air, mounting
on one another's shoulders, some in a riding and
some in a standing position, and by the slightest
push are all sent to the ground in one confused heap,
which made one fear for their safety.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Suppose, farther, many of the pilgrims dressed
in fur caps, like the Polish Jews, whom they feigned
to represent, and whom the mob met with all manner
of insult, hurrying them through the church as
criminals who had been condemned, amid loud execrations
and shouts of laughter, which indicated that
Israel is still a derision amongst these heathens, by
whom they are still counted as sheep for the
slaughter.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“About two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the
preparations for the miraculous fire commenced.
The multitude, who had been hitherto in a state of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
frenzy and madness, became a little more quiet, but
it proved a quiet that precedes a thunderstorm.
Bishops and priests, in full canonicals, then issued
forth from their respective quarters, with flags and
banners, crucifixes and crosses, lighted candles and
smoking censers, to join or rather to lead a procession,
which moved thrice round the church, invoking
every picture, altar, and relic in their way to aid
them in obtaining the miraculous fire.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The procession then returned to the place from
whence it started, and two grey-headed bishops, the
one of the Greek and the other of the Armenian
Church, were hurled by the soldiers through the
crowd, into the apartment which communicated with
that of the Holy Sepulchre, where they locked themselves
in; there the marvellous fire was to make its
first appearance, and from thence issue through the
small circular windows and the door, for the use of
the multitude. The eyes of all—men, women, and
children—were now directed towards the Holy Sepulchre
with an anxious expression, awaiting the
issue of their expectation. The mixed multitude,
each in his or her own language, were pouring forth
their clamorous prayers to the Virgin and the saints to
intercede for them on behalf of the object for which
they were assembled, and the same were tenfold increased
by the fanatic gestures and the waving of
the garments by the priests of their respective communions,
who were interested in the holy fire, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who were watching by the above-mentioned door
and circular windows, with torches in their hands,
ready to receive the virgin flame of the heavenly
fire, and carry it to their flocks.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In about twenty minutes from the time the
bishops locked themselves in the apartment of the Holy
Sepulchre, the miraculous fire made its appearance
through the door and the two small windows, as expected.
The priests were the first who lighted their
torches, and they set out on a gallop in the direction
of their lay brethren; but some of these errandless
and profitless messengers had the misfortune to be
knocked down by the crowd, and had their firebrands
wrested out of their hands, but some were
more fortunate, and safely reached their destination,
around whom the people flocked like bees, to have
their candles lighted. Others, however, were not
satisfied at having the holy fire second hand, but
rushed furiously towards the Holy Sepulchre, regardless
of their own safety, and that of those who obstructed
their way, though it has frequently happened
that persons have been trampled to death on
such occasions.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Those who were in the galleries let down their
candles by cords, and drew them up when they had
succeeded in their purpose. In a few minutes thousands
of flames were ascending, the smoke and the
heat of which rendered the church like the bottomless
pit. To satisfy themselves, as well as to convince
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Latins, the pilgrims, women as well as men,
shamefully exposed their bare bosoms to the action
of the flame of their lighted candles, to make their
adversaries believe the miraculous fire differs from
an ordinary one in being perfectly harmless.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The two bishops, who a little while before locked
themselves in the apartment of the Holy Sepulchre,
now sallied forth out of it. When the whole
multitude had their candles lighted, the bishops were
caught by the crowd, lifted upon their shoulders,
and carried to their chapels, amidst loud and triumphant
acclamations. They soon, however, reappeared
at the head of a similar procession to the one
before, as a pretended thank-offering to the Almighty
for the miraculous fire vouchsafed.”</span>—(P. 121, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et seq.</span></span>)

It appears, by comparing these two narratives of
one and the same thing, though separated by a distance
of a hundred and fifty years, that the only difference
which will be found between them is, that
in the time of Maundrell, 1697, the miraculous fire
was produced in about one minute's time, whilst the
performance of the same trick required twenty when
it was observed by Mr Calman. And, indeed, it
has been justly observed by both these writers, that
the exhibitors of the miraculous fire, having continued
so long to practise this imposture, cannot
leave it off without ruining their authority and
influence over those whom they have thus been
cheating for many centuries. This circumstance has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been most pointedly expressed by the author of the
work from which I have extracted Mr Calman's description
of this pious, or rather impious, fraud, and
who says:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Had it been an occasional miracle, as time had
rolled on, and truth had more and more illuminated
the human mind, the practice might have been gradually
discontinued. As the priests had grown
more honest, and the people more enlightened, they
might have mutually consigned these pious frauds
to the oblivion of the darker ages; and if the blush
of shame had risen up at the memories of the past,
the world would have respected them the more for
their honesty of purpose.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">annual miracle</span></em>, always of the same specific
kind, exhibited on the same spot, and at the
same hour,—an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">annual miracle</span></em>,—at what point of
time should this be discontinued? and, if discontinued,
would it not be manifest either that heaven
had forsaken its favourites, or that all the past had
been delusion and imposture?”</span>—(Pp. 127, 128.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And it is the authority of a church supported by
such impious and shameful impostures as this miraculous
fire that a number of Anglicans, including
several dignitaries of the church, are anxious of preserving
against Protestant encroachments, and protest
against the existence of the Protestant bishopric
of Jerusalem, for fear that it might injure the faith
of the pilgrims, and put an end to such sacred
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
juggleries as the one described above, which outrivals
the most superstitious practices of ancient
or modern Paganism! And it is for the predominance
of this same church that the autocrat of
Russia has now plunged Europe into a war which
may prove one of the bloodiest that modern times
have witnessed, and proclaimed a Græco-Russian
crusade against the Ottoman Porte and its Christian
allies! This last-named circumstance may, I
think, render it not uninteresting to my readers to
know the manner in which this question is viewed
by Russians of elevated rank and superior education.
I would therefore recommend to their attention
a little pamphlet<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a>
recently published in English
by an accomplished Russian, who had studied at the
University of Edinburgh, and had enjoyed friendly
intercourse with the most eminent characters of that
learned body, leaving with all those who had known
him a most favourable impression of his personal
character and talents. His opinions, therefore, are
not those of an ignorant fanatic, or a hireling of the
Government, but must be considered as an expression
of those entertained by the upper classes of
Russian society. He compares in this pamphlet
the position of Russia towards the followers of the
Eastern Church in Turkey, to that of England towards
the Protestants of other countries, saying:—
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You translate the Bible into all living languages,
not excluding the Turkish idiom, and you distribute
the holy volumes to the shopkeeper of Constantinople,
and to the shepherd who tends his camels amidst
the ruins of Ephesus. We are not as laborious propagators
of the faith; but yet we would fain intercede
in favour of the Turk when your copy of the
Bible has converted him to the Christian faith, and
who, by the law of the land, must have his head cut
off for this transgression. Mark that the obligation
is much more binding on us than it is on you, and
not the less binding from the job having been begun
by yourselves. The Turks are spread amongst the
Greeks and surrounded by them. There are ten
thousand chances to one, that if the Moslem be converted
at all, it is to that creed of which the church
stands in his immediate eye, and that creed is ours.
But, strange to say, it is because of that very chance
that we are to be prohibited from meddling in the
matter. With the French and with the English the
case is far different. They, indeed, we are told,
claim the right of protection only over thousands;
but you claim that same right over millions, and,
therefore, you shall not have it. The question you
may, however, say, is not fairly put, for should a
Turk be converted, and on the point of losing his
head, we are ready to interpose with our authority,
even though it be to the Greek Church that he
should have turned. Well! but place yourselves for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a moment in our situation. Are we to leave to you
the work which has been done in our vineyard, and
not stand up for those who have embraced the cross,
merely because there are millions in that realm who
embrace it? The case stands equally the same with
regard to the far greater number of human beings
who are born and have grown up in the profession
of our faith. Without attempting to prove that they
are exposed to constant cruelty and oppression, a
fact which has been strenuously denied without the
denial having ever been proved, it is abundantly
known, and an indisputable fact, that the Greeks are
in a state of continual bondage, deprived of the
dearest rights of men, condemned, in a religious
point of view, to a state of thraldom such as exists
in no other part of the world, inasmuch as the supreme
head of their church is installed in his dignity,
maintained in the same, or deposed by a sovereign
professing a faith hostile to his own. Is such
a state of things to be tolerated by those who are
its victims? and is not this in itself a hardship greater
than any other that can be imagined? The English
have given us, in a period, it is true, of greater zeal
for their faith, an example of active sympathy manifested
by them towards their brothers in belief, subjects
of a neighbouring and powerful sovereign. The
case was not as urgent as the one to which I compare
it, inasmuch as the Huguenots of France were
not the subjects of a Mussulman sovereign. But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this, perhaps, will be brought home as an argument
against me, for such is the hatred of sects proceeding
from the same faith, that England would, perhaps,
have borne more meekly the hardships endured by
the Calvinistic brethren, if they had been subjected
thereunto by a Soliman, and not by him who styled
himself the most Christian king of France. However
this may be, it is said at present that, whether
oppressed or no, the Greeks never solicited our intervention.
To this it may be answered, that the
whole difficulty would have been solved by the very
fact of the solicitation, for had they had the courage
and the means to send a similar and unanimous
message to the Emperor of Russia, they would have
had the strength and unanimity required themselves
to strike the blow, and make all intervention useless.
The fact of their having not risen as a man in their
own cause, is a sufficient explanation for their want
of boldness in soliciting their deliverance at the
hands of a foreign state. But laying aside the question
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjects</span></em> of the Ottoman empire professing
the Greek faith, to speak of the much more vital
interest of the faith itself, professed as it is by ourselves,
let it be permitted to me to submit to your
candid decision, if the work of defending that faith
does not belong pre-eminently to us, and neither to
the English nor the French. We tolerate in the
whole extent of our empire both the Roman Catholic
and the Lutheran communions of faith; we have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
millions of subjects professing both creeds; we build
churches for them. Long before the Roman Catholics
were emancipated in England, the posts of the
highest honour, of the greatest confidence, and of
the largest perquisites in the army, the senate, and
the supreme council of the empire, were opened indiscriminately
by us to men professing the Greek,
Roman, or Lutheran creeds. Is it because of our
tolerance with respect to sects not our own, that we
are condemned to be indifferent to the hardships of
those of our own faith? Are we not only to allow
your church to stand unmolested within our own
realm, but also to allow our own church to fall in
ruins within the limits of a neighbouring state? If
so, you condemn our toleration, you call it indifference
and disbelief.”</span>—(P. 9, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et seq.</span></span>)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is perfectly true that there are in Russia several
millions of Protestants and Roman Catholics, and
that many of the highest offices, civil as well as
military, are occupied by them; for it is well known
that the most efficient servants of the Russian
government are chiefly foreigners, either by birth or
extraction. This tolerance, however, is always getting
more and more restricted; and I have alluded above,
on pp. <a href="#Pg161" class="tei tei-ref">161-163</a>, to the persecution of the Greeks
united with Rome, as well as the systematical proselytism
by force and fraud amongst the Protestants
of the Baltic provinces. The author says that a
Mahometan who becomes a convert to Christianity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must lose his head by the laws of Turkey, but he
does not tell us what fate awaits a follower of the
Greek Church in Russia who would become a Roman
Catholic or a Protestant. M. de Custine relates, in
his well-known work on Russia,<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> that a Russian
gentleman, who enjoyed a high social position at
Moscow, published a work, which the censor allowed
in an unaccountable manner to pass, maintaining
that the influence of the Roman Catholic Church is
much more favourable to the progress of civilization
than that of the Græco-Russian one, and that the social
condition of Russia would have been much more advanced
by the former than it has been by the latter.
This work produced a great sensation, and the punishment
of the author of such a blasphemy was loudly demanded
by the orthodox Russians. This affair being
submitted to the Emperor, he declared that the author
was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insane</span></em>, and ordered to treat him accordingly.
The unfortunate individual consequently was put into
a madhouse, and though perfectly sane, was subjected
to the most rigorous treatment as a lunatic, so
that he nearly became in reality what he was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">officially</span></em>
declared to be, and it was only after several years of
this moral and physical torture that he was permitted
to have a little more liberty, though still retained in
confinement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not know what has become of this unfortunate
man, but the truth of this nameless act of tyranny
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has been fully admitted by Mr Gretsch, who wrote,
by the order of the Russian Government, an answer
to the work of Custine. He says that the individual
in question, a Mr Chadayeff, having committed an
action which the laws of Russia punish with great
severity, the Emperor Nicholas, desiring to save the
culprit from the penalty which he had incurred,
ordered, by an act of mercy, to treat him simply as a
madman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, I think that the penalty of physical death,
inflicted by the Turkish law on the converts from
Mahometanism to Christianity, may be considered
as humane, if compared to the murder of soul and
intellect by the slow process of a moral and physical
torture, to which a man has been subjected in Russia
for his religious opinions; and if such an atrocious
punishment was inflicted by an act of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imperial mercy</span></em>,
as a mitigation of the severity of the law, what would
it have been if the letter of that law had been fulfilled?

If, according to the opinion of the Russian writer, his
countrymen have a right of interfering in behalf of the
followers of their church in Turkey, on account of the
community of their faith, the same right is possessed
by Great Britain and other Protestant States, as well
as by France and other Roman Catholic powers, to interfere
in behalf of their brethren in the faith who are
oppressed by Russia. With regard to the observation
of the same author, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the Greeks are in a continual

state of bondage, deprived of the dearest rights of

state of thraldom such as exists in no other part of the
world, inasmuch as the supreme head of their church
is installed in his dignity, maintained in the same, or
deposed, by a sovereign professing a faith hostile to his
own,”</span> I must remark that he has forgotten, in saying
that such a state of thraldom exists not in any other
part of the world, to add, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">except in Russia</span></em>, because
all the Roman Catholic bishops and other dignitaries
of their church, as well as the Protestant superintendents,
presidents of consistories, &amp;c., <span class="tei tei-q">“are installed
in their dignity, maintained in the same, or
deposed, by a sovereign professing a faith hostile to

things to be tolerated by its victims? and is it not
in itself a hardship greater than any other that can
be imagined?”</span> is as much applicable to the Protestants

least, minus the arbitrary exclusion of the blood of
Christ from the holy communion given to laymen!
Is it not strange, that on the moment of abjuring
your reformations, you should fly into the arms of a
church which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></em> introduced reformations of its
own, and not appeal to that one church which professes
with evident truth to have admitted no changes
at all, and kept intact the purity of her tradition?
But, again, this is no theological disquisition. Witnessing,
however, as I said above, in your own kingdom,
the daily increasing influence of the Roman
See, you can surely understand how legitimately
jealous we must be of the same influence extending
within the precincts of our sheepfold. And, therefore,
not only is our faith to be preserved unmolested,
but the saving deed is to be done by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></em>, and not
through the agency of English and French ambassadors
or fleets, to be achieved in the name of the
faith we profess in common with our Greek brethren,
and by no means stipulated in the name of universal
freedom of thought. I think I have said enough to
prove the vital and cordial interest which Russia
cannot but take in the cause of her own church, and
of those who profess it in Turkey, and the paramount
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessity she is under of making that cause her

If the Russian author is so anxious to convert the
British Protestants to the Græco-Russian, or, as he
calls her, <span class="tei tei-q">“Græco-Catholic”</span> Church, he may translate
her controversial works into English, and build
places of worship where image-kissing, prostration,
incense, and holy water, may be exhibited for the edification
of the British heretics, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad libitum</span></span>. Nobody
will interfere with their ceremonies, not even with
their preachings against Protestantism, because its
disciples in Great Britain are satisfied with defending
their religion by spiritual weapons, and do not resort
to material arms, except in repressing either public
or private acts of violence. As regards the dogmatic
pre-eminence of his church over that of Rome,—her
rejection of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anti-apostolic double procession of
the Holy Ghost</span></em>,”</span>—which has been, I think, retained
by the English Church, &amp;c., I leave this subject to
the decision of theologians, but shall only observe
that the worship of images, relics, and other pagan
practices, which I have described in this chapter, do
not prove much in favour of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purity of her tradition</span></em>.
I would also ask whether it is in accordance
with this tradition that the Russian clergy, notwithstanding
all their claims to apostolic succession,
are governed by the Czar, who sometimes delegates
for this purpose a colonel of hussars,<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a> which office,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I believe, was never known, even in the most militant
of churches? It has been, indeed, well said by
the Marquis de Custine, that the Russian clergy are
but an army wearing regimentals somewhat different
from the dress of the regular troops of the empire.
The papas and their bishops are under the direction
of the emperor, a regiment of clerks, and that is all.<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a>
It is in order to extend the advantages of this military
organization to the Christians of Turkey that
Russia, according to the opinion of our author, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is

same necessity of making the cause of the Greeks

ended by making the same thing with their country.

The politico-religious complications into which Europe
has now been thrown by the ambition of Russia
have induced me particularly to dwell upon the
means which the church of that country offers for
the promotion of the political schemes of its rulers.
With regard to the superstitious practices borrowed
from Paganism, and peculiar to that church, the
most remarkable is, perhaps, that heathen custom
called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parentales</span></span>, mentioned before,
p. <a href="#Pg062" class="tei tei-ref">62</a>, and
which may be found in different parts of Russia.
People assemble on Monday, after the Easter week,
in churchyards, where they eat and drink to great
excess, in commemoration of their deceased relatives.
There are many other similar practices, as, for
instance, that of providing the dead body with a
kind of passport or written testimony of his religious
conduct, &amp;c., probably imported with the Christian
religion by the Greek Church, because at the time of
the conversion of Russia, this church had already
introduced painted though not carved<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> images,

St Augustinus complains, in his work entitled
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Labour of Monks,”</span> that certain people were,
even in his time, exercising a dishonest trade, hawking
about relics of martyrs, and he adds the following
significant words, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">should they really be relics
of martyrs</span></em>,”</span> from which we may infer, that even then
abuses and deceits were practised, by making simple
folks believe that bones, picked up any where, were
bones of saints. Since the origin of this abuse is so
ancient, there can be no doubt that it has greatly increased
during a long interval of years, particularly
as the world has been much corrupted since that age,
and has continued to deteriorate until it has arrived
at its present condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, the origin and root of this evil has been, that,
instead of discerning Jesus Christ in his Word, his
Sacraments, and his Spiritual Graces, the world has,
according to its custom, amused itself with his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
clothes, shirts, and sheets, leaving thus the principal
to follow the accessory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It did the same thing with the apostles, martyrs,
and other saints, and, instead of observing their lives
in order to imitate their examples, it directed all its
attention to the preservation and admiration of their
bones, shirts, sashes, caps, and other similar trash.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know well that there is a certain appearance of
real devotion and zeal in the allegation, that the relics
of Jesus Christ are preserved on account of the
honour which is rendered to him, and in order the
better to preserve his memory. But it is necessary
to consider what St Paul says, that every service
of God invented by man, whatever appearance of
wisdom it may have, is nothing better than vanity
and foolishness, if it has no other foundation than
our own devising. Moreover, it is necessary to set
the profit derived from it against the dangers with
which it is fraught, and it will thus be found that, to
have relics is a useless and frivolous thing, which
will most probably gradually lead towards idolatry,
because they cannot be handled and looked upon
without being honoured, and in doing this men will
very soon render them the honour which is due to
Jesus Christ. In short, the desire for relics is never
without superstition, and what is worse, it is usually
the parent of idolatry. Every one admits that the
reason why our Lord concealed the body of Moses,
was that the people of Israel should not be guilty of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worshipping it. Now, we may conclude that the
act to be avoided with regard to the body of Moses
must be equally shunned with regard to the bodies
of all other saints, and for the same reason—because it
is sin. But let us leave the saints, and consider what
St Paul says of Jesus Christ himself, for he protests
that he knew him not according to the flesh, but only
after his resurrection, signifying by these words,
that all that is carnal in Jesus Christ must be forgotten
and put aside, and that we should employ and
direct our whole affections to seek and possess him
according to the spirit. Consequently the pretence
that it is a good thing to have some memorials either
of himself or of the saints, to stimulate our piety, is
nothing but a cloak for indulging our foolish cravings
which have no reasonable foundation; and should
even this reason appear insufficient, it is openly
repugnant to what the Holy Ghost has declared by
the mouth of St Paul, and what can be said more?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is of no use to discuss the point whether it is
right or wrong to have relics merely to keep them as
precious objects, without worshipping them, because
experience proves that this is never the case.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true that St Ambrose, in speaking of
Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine the
Great, who sought with great trouble and expense
for the cross of our Lord, says that she did not worship
the wood, but the Lord who was suspended
upon it. But it is a very rare thing, that a heart disposed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to value any relics whatever should not become
to a certain degree polluted by some superstition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I admit that people do not arrive at once at open
idolatry, but they gradually advance from one abuse
to another until they fall into this extremity, and, indeed,
those who call themselves Christians have, in
this respect, idolatrised as much as Pagans ever did.
They have prostrated themselves, and knelt before
relics, just as if they were worshipping God; they
have burnt candles before them in sign of homage;
they have placed their confidence in them, and have
prayed to them, as if the virtue and the grace of God
had entered into them. Now, if idolatry be nothing
else than the transfer elsewhere of the honour which
is due to God, can it be denied that this is idolatry?
This cannot be excused by pretending that it was
only the improper zeal of some idiots or foolish
women, for it was a general custom approved by
those who had the government of the church, and
who had even placed the bones of the dead and other
relics on the high altar, in the greatest and most
prominent places, in order that they should be worshipped
with more certainty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is thus that the foolish fancy which people had
at first for collecting relics, ended in this open abomination,—they
not only turned from God, in order to
amuse themselves with vain and corruptible things,
but even went on to the execrable sacrilege of worshipping
dead and insensible creatures, instead of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one living God. Now, as one evil never comes alone
but is always followed by another, it thus happened
that where people were seeking for relics, either of
Jesus Christ or the saints, they became so blind that
whatever name was imposed upon any rubbish presented
to them, they received it without any examination
or judgment; thus the bones of an ass or dog,
which any hawker gave out to be the bones of a
martyr, were devoutly received without any difficulty.
This was the case with all of them, as will be
shown hereafter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For my own part, I have no doubt that this has
been a great punishment inflicted by God. Because,
as the world was craving after relics, and turning
them to a wicked and superstitious use, it was very
likely that God would permit one lie to follow
another; for this is the way in which he punishes the
dishonour done to his name, when the glory due to
him is transferred elsewhere. Indeed, the only reason
why there are so many false and imaginary relics
is, that God has permitted the world to be doubly deceived
and fallen, since it has so loved deceit and lies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first Christians left the bodies of the saints
in their graves, obeying the universal sentence, that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all flesh is dust, and</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">to dust it must return</span></span>, and
did not attempt their resurrection before the appointed
time by raising them in pomp and state.
This example has not been followed by their successors;
on the contrary, the bodies of the faithful,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in opposition to the command of God, have been
disinterred in order to be glorified, when they ought
to have remained in their places of repose awaiting
the last judgment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They were worshipped; every kind of honour was
shown to them, and people put their trust in such
things. And what was the consequence of all this?
The devil, perceiving man's folly, was not satisfied
with having led the world into one deception, but
added to it another, by giving the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relics
of saints</span></em> to the most profane things. And God
punished the credulous by depriving them of all
power of reasoning rightly, so that they accepted
without inquiry all that was presented to them,
making no distinction between white or black.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not my intention now to discuss the abominable
abuse of the relics of our Lord, as well as of
the saints, at this present time, in the most part of
Christendom. This subject alone would require a
separate volume; for it is a well-known fact that
the most part of the relics which are displayed
every where are false, and have been put forward by
impostors who have most impudently deceived the
poor world. I have merely mentioned this subject,
to give people an opportunity of thinking it
over, and of being upon their guard. It happens
sometimes that we carelessly approve of a thing
without taking the necessary time to examine what
it really is, and we are thus deceived for want of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
warning; but when we are warned, we begin to
think, and become quite astonished at our believing
so easily such an improbability. This is precisely
what has taken place with the subject in question.
People were told, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the body of such a saint;
these are his shoes, those are his stockings;”</span> and
they believed it to be so, for want of timely caution.
But when I shall have clearly proved the fraud
which has been committed, all those who have sense
and reason will open their eyes and begin to reflect
upon what has never before entered their thoughts.
The limits of my little volume forbid me from entering
but upon a small part of what I would wish
to perform, for it would be necessary to ascertain
the relics possessed by every place in order to compare
them with each other. It would then be seen
that every apostle had more than four bodies,<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> and
each saint at least two or three, and so on. In
short, if all the relics were collected into one heap,
the only astonishment would be that such a silly
and clumsy imposition could have blinded the whole
earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As every, even the smallest Catholic church has
a heap of bones and other small rubbish, what would
it be if all those things which are contained in two
or three thousand bishoprics, twenty or thirty thousand
abbeys, more than forty thousand convents,
and so many parish churches and chapels, were collected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into one mass?<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> The best thing would be
not merely to name, but to visit them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this town (Geneva) there was formerly, it is
said, an arm of St Anthony; it was kissed and worshipped
as long as it remained in its shrine; but
when it was turned out and examined, it was found
to be the bone of a stag. There was on the high
altar the brain of St Peter; so long as it rested in
its shrine, nobody ever doubted its genuineness, for
it would have been blasphemy to do so; but when
it was subjected to a close inspection, it proved to
be a piece of pumice-stone. I could quote many
instances of this kind; but these will be sufficient
to give an idea of the quantity of precious rubbish
there would have been found if a thorough and universal
investigation of all the relics of Europe had
ever taken place. Many of those who look at relics
close their eyes from superstition, so that in regarding
these they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></em> nothing; that is to say, they
dare not properly gaze at and consider what they
properly may be. Thus many who boast of having
seen the whole body of St Claude, or of any other
saint, have never had the courage to raise their eyes
and to ascertain what it really was. The same thing
may be said of the head of Mary Magdalene, which
is shown near Marseilles, with eyes of paste or wax.
It is valued as much as if it were God himself who
had descended from heaven; but if it were examined,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the imposition would be clearly detected.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a>
It would be desirable to have an accurate knowledge
of all the trifles which in different places are
taken for relics, or at least a register of them, in
order to show how many of them are false; but
since it is impossible to obtain this, I should like to
have at least an inventory of relics contained in
ten or twelve such towns as Paris, Toulouse, Poitiers,
Rheims, &amp;c. If I had nothing more than this,
it would form a very curious collection. Indeed, it
is a wish I am constantly entertaining to get such a
precious repertory. However, as this is too difficult,
I thought it would be as well to publish the following
little warning, to awaken those who are asleep,
and to make them consider what may be the state
of the entire church if there is so much to condemn
in a very small portion of it;—I mean, when people
find so much deception in the relics I shall name,
and which are far from being the thousandth part
of those that are exhibited in various parts of the
world, what must they think of the remainder?
moreover, if those which had been considered as
the most authentic proved to be fraudulent inventions,
what can be thought of the more doubtful
ones? Would to God that Christian princes thought
a little on this subject! for it is their duty not to
allow their subjects to be deceived, not only by
false doctrine, but also by such manifest impositions.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
They will indeed incur a heavy responsibility for
allowing God to be thus mocked when they could
prevent it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I hope, however, that this little treatise will be of
general service, by inducing people to think on the
subject; for, if we could have the register of all
the relics that are to be found in the world,
men would clearly see how much they had been
blinded, and what darkness and folly overspread the
earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us begin with Jesus Christ, about whose blood
there have been fierce disputations; for many maintained
that he had no blood except of a miraculous
kind; nevertheless the natural blood is exhibited in
more than a hundred places. They show at Rochelle
a few drops of it, which, as they say, was collected
by Nicodemus in his glove. In some places they
have phials full of it, as, for instance, at Mantua and
elsewhere; in other parts they have cups filled with
it, as in the Church of St Eustache at Rome. They
did not rest satisfied with simple blood; it was considered
necessary to have it mixed with water as it
flowed out of his side when pierced on the cross.
This is preserved in the Church of St John of the
Lateran at Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, I appeal to the judgment of every one
whether it is not an evident lie to maintain that the
blood of Jesus Christ was found, after a lapse of
seven or eight hundred years, to be distributed over
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the whole world, especially as the ancient church
makes no mention of it?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then come the things which have touched the
body of our Lord. Firstly, the manger in which he
was placed at his birth is shown in the Church of
Madonna Maggiore at Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In St Paul's Church there are preserved the
swaddling clothes in which he was wrapped, though
there are pieces of these clothes at Salvatierra in
Spain. His cradle is also at Rome, as well as the
shirt his mother made for him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the Church of St James, in the same city, is
shown the altar upon which he was placed at his
presentation in the temple, as if there had been
many altars, according to the fashion of the Popish
churches, where any number of them may be erected.
This is what they show relating to the time of
Christ's childhood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is, indeed, not worth while seriously to discuss
whence they obtained all this trash, so long a time
after the death of Jesus Christ. That man must be
of little mind who cannot see the folly of it. There
is no mention of these things in the Gospels, and
they were never heard of in the times of the
apostles. About fifty years after the death of Jesus
Christ, Jerusalem was destroyed. Many ancient
doctors have written since, mentioning fully the occurrences
of their time, even to the cross and nails
found by Helena, but these absurdities are not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
alluded to. But what is more, these things were
not brought forward at Rome during the days of St
Gregory, as may be seen from his writings; whilst
after his death Rome was several times taken, pillaged,
and almost destroyed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, what other conclusion can be drawn from
these considerations but that all these were inventions
for deceiving silly folks? This has even been
confessed by some monks and priests, who call them
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pious frauds</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">honest deceits</span></em> for exciting the
devotion of the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After these come the relics belonging to the period
from the childhood to the death of Jesus Christ,
such as the water pots in which Christ changed
water into wine at the marriage feast of Cana in
Galilee.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One would naturally inquire how they were preserved
for so long a time? for it is necessary to bear
in mind that they were not discovered until eight
hundred or a thousand years after the performance
of the miracle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot tell all the places where these water pots
are shown; I only know that they can be seen at
Pisa, Ravenna, Cluny, Antwerp, and Salvatierra in
Spain.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>

At Orleans they have even the wine which was
obtained by that miracle, and once a-year the priests
there give to those who bring offerings a small
spoonful, saying that they shall taste of the very
wine made by our Lord at the marriage feast, and
its quantity never decreases, the cup being always
refilled. I do not know of what date are his shoes,
which are preserved in a place at Rome called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sancta Sanctorum</span></span>, or whether he had worn them
in his childhood or manhood; but this is of little
moment, for what I have already mentioned sufficiently
shows the gross imposition of producing now
the shoes of Jesus Christ, which were not possessed by
the apostles in their time.

Now, let us proceed to the last supper which
Christ had with his apostles. The table is at St
John of the Lateran at Rome; some bread made
for that occasion at Salvatierra in Spain; and the
knife with which the paschal lamb was carved is at
Tréves. Now, it is necessary to observe that Christ
made that supper in a borrowed room, and on going
from thence he left the table, which was not removed
by the apostles. Jerusalem was soon afterwards
destroyed. How, then, could the table be
found after a lapse of eight hundred years?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, in the early ages tables were made of
quite a different shape to those of our days, for
people then took their repasts in a lying, not in a
sitting posture—a circumstance expressly mentioned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the Gospels. The deceit is therefore quite manifest,
without more being added to prove it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cup in which Christ gave the sacrament of
his blood to the apostles is shown at Notre Dame
de l'Isle, near Lyons; and there is another in a
convent of Augustine monks in the Albigéois;—which
is the true one? Charles Sigonius, a celebrated
historian of our times, says, in his fourth
book on Italy, that Baldwin, second king of Jerusalem,
captured in 1101, with the assistance of the
Genoese, the town of Cesarea in Syria, and amongst
the spoils taken by his allies was a vessel or cup
of emerald, which was considered to have been
made use of by Jesus Christ at his last supper.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore,”</span>—these are his own words,—<span class="tei tei-q">“this
cup is even now devoutly preserved in the town of
Genoa.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to this account, our Lord must have
had a splendid service on that occasion; for there
would be as little propriety in drinking from such a
costly vessel without having the rest of the service
of a similar description, as there is in some Popish
pictures where the Virgin Mary is represented as a
woman with her hair hanging over her shoulders,
dressed in a gown of cloth of gold, and riding on a
donkey which Joseph leads by the halter. We recommend
our readers to consider well the Gospel
texts relating to this subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The case of the dish upon which the paschal lamb
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was placed is still worse, for it is to be found at
Rome, at Genoa, and at Arles. If these holy relics
be genuine, the customs of that time must have been
quite different from ours, because, instead of changing
viands as we now do, the dishes were changed
for the same food!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same may be said of the towel with which
Jesus Christ wiped the feet of the apostles, after
having washed them; there is one at Rome at the
Lateran, one at Aix-la-Chapelle, and one at St Corneille
of Compiegne, with the print of the foot of
Judas. Some of these must be false.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But we will leave the contending parties to fight
out their own battles, until one of them shall establish
the reality of his case. It appears to me, however,
that trying to make people believe that a towel
which Jesus Christ had left in the place where it
was used, had in several hundred years afterwards
found its way into Germany and Italy, is nothing
better than a gross imposture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I nearly forgot to mention the bread with which
five thousand persons were miraculously fed in the
desert, and of which a bit is shown at Rome, and
another piece at Salvatierra in Spain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Scripture says that a portion of manna was
preserved in remembrance of God having miraculously
fed his people in the desert; but the Gospel
does not say a word respecting the preservation of
the fragments of the five loaves for a similar purpose;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the subject is not mentioned in any ancient history,
nor does any ecclesiastical writer speak of it. It is
therefore very easily perceived that the above-mentioned
pieces of bread are of modern manufacture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principal relics of our Lord are, however,
those relating to his passion and death. And the
first of them is the cross. I know that it is considered
to be a certain fact that it was found by
Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine;
and I know also that some ancient doctors have
written about the manner in which the discovery
was certified that it was the true cross upon which
our Lord had suffered. I think, however, that it
was a foolish curiosity, and a silly and inconsiderate
devotion, which prompted Helena to seek for that
cross. But let us take for granted that it was a
laudable act, and that our Lord had declared by a
miracle that it was the real cross, and let us consider
only the state of the case in our own time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is maintained undoubtingly that the cross
found by Helena is still at Jerusalem, though this is
contradicted by ecclesiastical history, which relates
that Helena took a piece of it, and sent it to her
son the emperor, who set it upon a column of porphyry,
in the centre of a public place or square,
whilst the other portion of it was enclosed by her in
a silver case, and intrusted to the keeping of the
Bishop of Jerusalem; consequently, either the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before-mentioned statement or this historical record
must be false.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now let us consider how many relics of the true
cross there are in the world. An account of those
merely with which I am acquainted would fill a
whole volume, for there is not a church, from a
cathedral to the most miserable abbey or parish
church, that does not contain a piece. Large splinters
of it are preserved in various places, as for instance
in the Holy Chapel at Paris, whilst at Rome
they show a crucifix of considerable size made entirely,
they say, from this wood. In short, if we
were to collect all these pieces of the true cross exhibited
in various parts, they would form a whole
ship's cargo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Gospel testifies that the cross could be borne
by one single individual; how glaring, then, is the
audacity now to pretend to display more relics of
wood than three hundred men could carry! As an
explanation of this, they have invented the tale, that
whatever quantity of wood may be cut off this true
cross, its size never decreases. This is, however, such
a clumsy and silly imposture, that the most superstitious
may see through it. The most absurd stories
are also told respecting the manner in which various
pieces of the cross were conveyed to the places
where they are now shown; thus, for instance, we
are informed that they were brought by angels, or
had fallen from heaven. By these means they seduce
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ignorant people into idolatry, for they are not
satisfied with deceiving the credulous, by affirming
that pieces of common wood are portions of the true
cross, but they pretend that it should be worshipped,
which is a diabolical doctrine, expressly reproved by
St Ambrose as a Pagan superstition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the cross comes the inscription, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the Jews</span></em>,”</span> which was placed
upon it by order of Pilate. The town of Toulouse
claims the possession of this relic, but this is contradicted
by Rome, where it is shown in the Church of
the Holy Cross. If these relics were properly examined,
it would be seen that the claims of both
parties are equally absurd.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a still greater contradiction concerning
the nails of the cross. I shall name those with
which I am acquainted, and I think even a child
could see how the devil has been mocking the world
by depriving it of the power of discernment on this
point. If the ancient writers, such as the ecclesiastical
historian Theodorite, tell the truth (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Historia
Tripartita</span></span>, lib. ii.), Helena caused one of the nails to
be set in the helmet of her son Constantine, and two
others in the bridle of his horse. St Ambrose, however,
relates this differently, saying that one of the nails
was set in the crown of Constantine, a second was
converted into a bridle-bit for his horse, and the
third was retained by Helena. Thus we see that
twelve hundred years ago there was a difference of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opinion on this subject, and how can we tell what
has become of the nails since that time? Now, they
boast at Milan that they possess the nail which was
in Constantine's bridle; this claim is, however,
opposed by the town of Carpentras. St Ambrose
does not say that the nail was attached to the bridle,
but that the bit was made from it,—a circumstance
which does not agree with the claims of Milan or
Carpentras. There is, moreover, one nail in the
Church of St Helena at Rome, and another in that
of the Holy Cross in the same city; there is a nail
at Sienna, and another at Venice. Germany possesses
two, at Cologne and Tréves. In France there
is one in the Holy Chapel at Paris, another in the
same city at the church of the Carmelites, a third is
at St Denis, a fourth at Bruges, a fifth at the abbey
of Tenaille in the Saintonge, a sixth at Draguignau,
the whole number making fourteen shown in different
towns and countries.<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a>
Each place exhibiting
these nails produces certain proofs to establish the
genuineness of its relic, but all these claims may be
placed on a par as equally absurd.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then follows the iron spear with which our
Saviour's side was pierced. It could be but one,
and yet by some extraordinary process it seems to
have been multiplied into four; for there is one at
Rome, one at the Holy Chapel at Paris, one at the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abbey of Tenaille in Saintonge, and one at Selve,
near Bourdeaux.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to the crown of thorns, one must
believe that the slips of which it was plaited had
been planted, and had produced an abundant
growth, for otherwise it is impossible to understand
how it could have increased so much.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A third part of this crown is preserved at the
Holy Chapel at Paris, three thorns at the Church of
the Holy Cross, and a number of them at St
Eustache in the same city; there are a good many
of the thorns at Sienna, one at Vicenza, four at
Bourges, three at Besançon, three at Port Royal,
and I do not know how many at Salvatierra in
Spain, two at St James of Compostella, three at
Albi, and one at least in the following places:—Toulouse,
Macon, Charroux in Poitiers; at Cleri, St
Flour, St Maximim in Provence, in the abbey of
La Salle at St Martin of Noyon, &amp;c.<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be observed, that the early church has
made no mention of this crown, consequently the
root that produced all these relics must have grown a
long time after the passion of our Lord. With regard
to the coat, woven throughout without a seam, for
which the soldiers at the cross cast lots, there is one
to be seen at Argenteuil near Paris, and another at
Tréves in Germany.

It is now time to treat of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sudary</span></em>,”</span> about
which relic they have displayed their folly even
more than in the affair of the holy coat; for besides
the sudary of Veronica, which is shown in the
Church of St Peter at Rome, it is the boast of several
towns that they each possess one, as for instance
Carcassone, Nice, Aix-la-Chapelle, Tréves, Besançon,
without reckoning the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fragments</span></em> to be seen in various

Now, I ask whether those persons were not bereft
of their senses who could take long pilgrimages, at
much expense and fatigue, in order to see sheets, of
the reality of which there were no reasons to believe,
but many to doubt; for whoever admitted the reality
of one of these sudaries shown in so many places,
must have considered the rest as wicked impostures
set up to deceive the public by the pretence that
they were each the real sheet in which Christ's body
had been wrapped. But it is not only that the exhibitors
of this one and the same relic give each
other mutually the lie, they are (what is far more
important) positively contradicted by the Gospel.
The evangelists who speak of all the women who
followed our Lord to the place of crucifixion, make
not the least mention of that Veronica who wiped
his face with a kerchief. It was in truth a most
marvellous and remarkable event, worthy of being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
recorded, that the face of Jesus Christ was then
miraculously imprinted upon the cloth, a much more
important thing to mention than the mere circumstance
that certain women had followed Jesus Christ
to the place of crucifixion without meeting with any
miracle; and, indeed, had such a miracle taken
place, we might consider the evangelists wanting in
judgment in not relating the most important facts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same observations are applicable to the tale
of the sheet in which the body of our Lord was
wrapped. How is it possible that those sacred historians,
who carefully related all the miracles that
took place at Christ's death, should have omitted
to mention one so remarkable as the likeness of the
body of our Lord remaining on its wrapping sheet?
This fact undoubtedly deserved to be recorded. St
John, in his Gospel, relates even how St Peter,
having entered the sepulchre, saw the linen clothes
lying on one side, and the napkin that was about
his head on the other; but he does not say that there
was a miraculous impression of our Lord's figure
upon these clothes, and it is not to be imagined that
he would have omitted to mention such a work of
God if there had been any thing of this kind.
Another point to be observed is, that the evangelists
do not mention that either of the disciples or the
faithful women who came to the sepulchre had
removed the clothes in question, but, on the contrary,
their account seems to imply that they were left
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there. Now, the sepulchre was guarded by soldiers,
and consequently the clothes were in their power.
Is it possible that they would have permitted the
disciples to take them away as relics, since these
very men had been bribed by the Pharisees to perjure
themselves by saying that the disciples had
stolen the body of our Lord? I shall conclude with
a convincing proof of the audacity of the Papists.
Wherever the holy sudary is exhibited, they show a
large sheet with the full-length likeness of a human
body on it. Now, St John's Gospel, chapter nineteenth,
says that Christ was buried according to the
manner of the Jews; and what was their custom?
This may be known by their present custom on such
occasions, as well as from their books, which describe
the ancient ceremony of interment, which was to
wrap the body in a sheet, to the shoulders, and to
cover the head with a separate cloth. This is precisely
how the evangelist described it, saying, that
St Peter saw on one side the clothes with which the
body had been wrapped, and on the other the
napkin from about his head. In short, either St
John is a liar, or all those who boast of possessing
the holy sudary are convicted of falsehood and
deceit.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Church of St John of the Lateran at Rome,
they show the reed which the soldiers, mocking
Christ in the house of Pilate, placed in his hand,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and with which they afterwards smote him on the
head. In the Church of the Holy Cross at Rome they
show the sponge which was filled with vinegar, and
given him to drink during his passion. Now, I would
ask, how were these things obtained? They must
have been formerly in the hands of infidels. Could
they have delivered them up to the apostles to be
made relics of? or did they preserve them themselves
for future times?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What a sacrilege to make use of the name of
Jesus Christ in order to invent such absurd fables!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And what can we think of the pieces of silver received
by Judas for betraying our Saviour? The
Gospel says that he returned this money to the chief
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
priests, who bought with it the potter's field for a
burial-place for strangers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By what means were these pieces of silver obtained
from the seller of that field? It would be too absurd
to maintain that this was done by the disciples of
Jesus Christ; and if we are told that they were found
a long time afterwards, it will be still less probable,
as this money must have passed through many hands.
It is therefore necessary to prove, that either the
person who sold his field did so for the purpose of
obtaining the silver pieces in order to make relics of
them; or that he afterwards sold them to the faithful.
Nothing of this kind has ever been mentioned
by the primitive church.<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a> To the same class of impositions
belong the steps of Pilate's tribunal, which
are exhibited in the Church of St John of the Lateran,
as well as the column to which Christ was fastened
during the flagellation, shown in the Church of
St Prasedo in the same city, besides two other pillars,
round which he was conducted on his way to Calvary.
From whence these columns were taken it is
impossible to conjecture. I only know that the Gospel,
in relating that Jesus Christ was scourged, does
not mention that he was fastened to a column or
post. It really appears as if these impostors had no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other aim than to promulgate the most fallacious
statements, and, indeed, they carried this to such a
degree of extravagance, that they were not ashamed
to make a relic of the tail of the ass upon which our
Lord entered into Jerusalem, which they show at
Genoa.<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> One really cannot tell which is most wonderful,—the
folly and credulity of those who devoutly
receive such mockeries, or the boldness of those who
put them forth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be said that it is not likely all these relics
should be preserved without some sort of correct history
being kept of them. To this I reply that such
evident falsehoods can never bear the slightest resemblance
to truth, how much soever their claims may
be supported by the names of Constantine, Louis
IX., or of some popes; for they will never be able to
prove that Christ was crucified with fourteen nails,
or that a whole hedge was used to plait his crown of
thorns,—that the iron of the spear with which his side
was pierced had given birth to three other similar
pieces of iron,—that his coat was multiplied threefold,—and
that from his single sudarium a number of
others have issued, or that Jesus Christ was buried
in a manner different from that described in the
Gospels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, if I were to show a piece of lead, saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">“This piece of gold was given me by a certain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prince,”</span> I should be considered a madman, and my
words would not transmute the lead into gold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus it is precisely when people say, <span class="tei tei-q">“This thing
was sent over by Godfrey de Bouillon after his conquest
of Judea.”</span> Our reason shows us that this is
an evident lie. Are we then to be so much imposed
upon by words as to resist the evidence of our
senses?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, in order to show how much reliance may
be placed on the statements which are given about
these relics, we must remark that those considered
the principal and most authentic at Rome have been,
according to those accounts, brought thither by Vespasian
and Titus. Now, this is such a clumsy fabrication,—they
might just as well tell us that the Turks
went to Jerusalem in order to carry off the true cross
to Constantinople!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vespasian conquered and ravaged a part of Judea
before he was elected emperor, and his son Titus
completed that conquest by the capture and destruction
of Jerusalem. They were both Pagans, and had
no more regard for Christ than if he had never
existed on earth. Consequently to maintain that
Vespasian and Titus carried off the above-mentioned
relics to Rome, is even a more flagrant falsehood
than the stories about Godfrey of Bouillon and St
Louis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, it is well known that the times of St
Louis were very superstitious. That monarch would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have accepted as a relic, and worshipped, any thing
that was represented to him as having belonged to
the Holy Virgin; and, indeed, King Louis and
other crusaders sacrificed their bodies and their
goods, as well as a great portion of their country's
substance, merely to bring back with them heaps of
foolish trifles, having been taught to consider them
as the most precious jewels of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be here mentioned, that in Greece, Asia
Minor, and other eastern countries, people show,
with full assurance, counterpart old rubbish, which
those poor idolaters imagine they possess in their
own country. How are we to judge between the
two contending parties? One party says that these
relics were brought from the East; but the Christians
now inhabiting those lands maintain that the
same relics are still in their possession, and they
laugh at our pretensions. How can it be decided
betwixt right and wrong without an inquiry, which
will never take place? Methinks the best plan is
to let the dispute rest as it is, without caring for
either side of the question.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last relics pertaining to Jesus Christ are
those which relate to the time after his resurrection,—as,
for instance, a piece of broiled fish which St
Peter presented to him on the sea-shore. This fish
must have been strongly spiced, and prepared in
some extraordinary manner, to be preserved for so
long a period. But, seriously, is it likely that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apostles would have made a relic of a portion of the
fish which they had prepared for their dinner? Indeed,
I think that whoever will not perceive this to
be an open mockery of God, deserves not to be
reasoned with.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is also the miraculous blood which has
flowed from several hosts,—as, for instance, in the
Churches of St Jean-en-Greve at Paris, at St Jean
d'Angeli at Dijon, and in many other places. They
show even the penknife with which the host at Paris
was pierced by a Jew, and which the poor Parisians
hold in as much reverence as the host itself. For
this they were well blamed by a Roman Catholic
priest, who declared them to be worse than the
Jews, for worshipping the knife with which the precious
body of Christ was pierced. I think we may
apply this observation to the nails, the spear, and
the thorns; and consequently those who worship
those instruments used at our Lord's crucifixion are
more wicked than the Jews who employed them for
that purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are many other relics belonging to this period
of our Lord's history, but it would be tedious
to enumerate them all. We shall therefore pass
them over, and say a few words respecting his
images,—not the common ones made by painters
and carvers, but those considered as actual relics,
and held in particular veneration. Some of these
images are believed to have been made in a miraculous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
manner, like those shown at Rome in the
Church of the blessed Virgin, in Portici, at St John
of the Lateran, at Lucca, and other places, and
which they pretend were painted by angels. I think
it would be ridiculous to undertake a serious refutation
of these absurdities, the profession of angels not
being that of painters, and our Lord Jesus Christ
desired to be known and remembered otherwise than
by carnal images.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eusebius, it is true, relates, in his Ecclesiastical
History, that our Lord sent the likeness of his face
to King Abgarus;<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> but the authenticity of this account
has no better proof than that of a fairy tale;
yet, supposing it were true, how came this likeness
to be found at Rome (out of Abgarus' possession),
where people boast to have it now? Eusebius does
not mention where it was in his time, but he merely
relates the story as having happened a long time before
he wrote; we must therefore suppose that this
image reappeared after a lapse of many centuries,
and came from Edessa to Rome.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They have forged not only images of Christ's
body, but also copies of the cross. Thus they pretend
at Brescia to have the identical cross which
appeared to the Emperor Constantine. This claim
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is, however, stoutly opposed by the town of Constance,
whose inhabitants maintain that the above-mentioned
cross is preserved in their town, and not
at Brescia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But let us leave the contending parties to settle
this point between themselves, though it would be
easy enough to show the absurdity of their pretensions,
because the cross which, according to some
writers, appeared to Constantine, was not a material
cross, but simply a vision.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are several carved images, as well as paintings,
of Jesus Christ to which many miracles are
attributed. Thus the beard grows on the crucifixes
of Salvatierra and Orange, and other images are said
to shed tears. These things are too absurd for serious
refutation, and yet the deluded world is so infatuated
that the majority put as much faith in these
as in the Gospels.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Blessed Virgin.</span></span>—The belief that the body of
the Virgin was not interred on earth, but was taken
to heaven, has deprived them of all pretext for manufacturing
any relics of her remains, which otherwise
might have been sufficiently abundant to fill a

yet in order to have at least
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
something belonging to her, they sought to indemnify
themselves for the absence of other relics with
the possession of her hair and her milk. The hair is
shown in several churches at Rome, and at Salvatierra
in Spain, at Maçon, St Flour, Cluny, Nevers,
and in many other towns. With regard to the milk,
there is not perhaps a town, a convent, or nunnery,
where it is not shown in large or small quantities.
Indeed, had the Virgin been a wet-nurse her whole
life, or a dairy, she could not have produced more
than is shown as hers in various parts.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>
How they obtained all this milk they do not say, and it is
superfluous here to remark that there is no foundation
in the Gospels for these foolish and blasphemous
extravagances.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Virgin's wardrobe has produced an abundant
store of relics. There is a shirt of hers at Chartres,
which has been fully celebrated as an idol, and there
is another at Aix-la-Chapelle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not know how these things could have been
obtained, for it is certain that the Apostles and first
Christians were not such triflers as to amuse themselves
in this way. It is, however, sufficient for us
to consider the shape of these articles of dress, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
order clearly to see the impudence of their exhibitors.
The shirt at Aix-la-Chapelle is a long clerical surplice,
shown hanging to a pole, and if the Blessed
Virgin had been a giantess, she would still have felt
much inconvenience in wearing so large a garment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the same church they preserve the shoes of St
Joseph, which could only fit the foot of a little child
or a dwarf. The proverb says that liars need good
memories, so as not to contradict their own sayings.
This rule was not followed out at Aix-la-Chapelle,
otherwise care would have been taken to maintain a
better proportion of size between the shoes of the
husband and the shirt of the wife. And yet these
relics, so devoid of all appearance of truth, are devoutly
kissed and venerated by crowds!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know of only two of her head-dresses; one is at
the abbey of St Maximian at Treves, and the other
is at Lisio in Italy. They may be considered quite
as genuine as the Virgin's girdle at Prato and at
Montserrat, as her slipper at St Jaqueme, and as her
shoe at St Flour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, those who are at all conversant with this subject
well know that it was not the custom of the primitive
church to collect shoes and stockings, &amp;c., for
relics, and also that for five hundred years after the
death of the Virgin Mary there was never any talk
of such things. It really seems as if these well-known
facts would be sufficient to prove the absurdity of all
these relics of the Virgin; but her worshippers, not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
merely satisfied with the articles I have just enumerated,
endeavour to ascribe to her a love of dress and
finery. A comb of hers is shown in the church of
St Martin at Rome, and another in that of St Jean-le-Grand
at Besançon, besides others that may be
shown elsewhere. Now, if this be not a mockery of
the Virgin, I do not know what that word implies.
They have not forgotten her wedding-ring, which is
shown at Perusa.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As it is now the custom for a husband to present
his bride with a ring at the marriage ceremony,
they imagined it to be so in the time of the Virgin,
and in her country, consequently, they show a splendid
ring as the one used at her wedding, forgetting
the state of poverty in which she lived.

Rome possesses four of her gowns, in the churches
of St John of the Lateran, St Barbara, St Maria

they boast of having fragments of a gown belonging
to her.

It is sufficient to examine the materials of these
vestments in order to see the falsehood of their
claims, for their exhibitors give to the Virgin the
same sort of robes with which they dress up her
images.

It remains now to speak of her images—not of
the common ones, of which there are so many everywhere,
but of those which are distinguished from the
rest by some particular claims. Thus at Rome there
are four, which they pretend were painted by St
Luke the evangelist. The principal one is in the
church of St Augustine, which they say St Luke
had painted for his own use; he always carried it
about his person, and it was buried with him.
Now, is it not a downright blasphemy to turn thus a
holy evangelist into a perfect idolater? And what
reason had they for believing that St Luke was a
painter? St Paul calls him a physician. I do not
know from whence they obtained this notion; but
supposing it was so, is it possible to admit that he
would have painted the Virgin for the same purpose
as the Pagans did a Jupiter, a Venus, or any other
idol?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was not the custom of the primitive Christians
to have images, and it only became so a long while
afterwards, when the Church was corrupted by

It may be supposed that I am joking when I speak
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relics of an angel</span></em>, considering how absurd and
ridiculous it is to do so, yet, although the hypocrites
certainly know this well, they have made use of the
name of St Michael to delude the ignorant and foolish;
for they show at Carcassone his falchion, which
looks like a child's dagger, and his shield, which is
no larger than the knob of a bridle. Is it possible
for man or woman to exist who can believe such

of devotion, against God and his angels. The exhibitors
of the above-mentioned relics endeavour to
support their imposture by the testimony of Scripture
that the archangel Michael combated with Satan; but
if he was conquered by the sword, it would at least
have been one of a different size and calibre than
the toy to which I have alluded. People must,
however, be very silly to believe that the war waged
by angels and the faithful against the devil is a carnal

as I said before, at the commencement of this treatise,
the world has rightly deserved to be led astray
into such absurdities, for having lusted after idols,

ST JOHN THE BAPTIST.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proceeding in due order, we must now treat of St
John the Baptist, who, according to the evangelical
history—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, God's Word of Truth—was, after being
beheaded, buried by his disciples. Theodoret, the
eminent chronicler of the Church, relates that his
grave was at Sebaste, a town in Syria, and that
some time after his burial the grave was opened by
the Pagans, who burnt his bones and scattered their
ashes in the air. Eusebius adds, however, that some
men from Jerusalem, who were present on the occasion,
secretly took a little of these ashes and carried
them to Antioch, where they were buried in a wall
by Athanasius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to his head, Sosomen, another chronicler,
relates that it was carried to Constantinople
by the Emperor Theodosius; therefore, according to
these ancient historians, the whole body of John the
Baptist was burnt with the exception of his head,
and the ashes were all lost excepting the small
portion secretly taken away by the hermits of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jerusalem. Now, let us see what remains of the
head are extant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The face is shown at Amiens, and the mask which
is there exhibited has a mark above the eye, caused,
they say, by the thrust of a knife, made by Herodias.
Amiens' claim to this relic is, however, disputed by
the inhabitants of St John d'Angeli, who show another
face of St John.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to the rest of the head, its top, from
the forehead to the back part, was at Rhodes, and I
suppose must now be at Malta, at least the knights
boast that the Turks had restored it to them. The
back of the head is at St John's Church at Nemours,
the brains at Nogent le Rotrou, a part of the head
is at St Jean Maximin, a jaw is at Besançon, a
portion of a jaw is at St John of the Lateran, and a
part of the ear at St Flour in Auvergne. All this
does not prevent Salvatierra from possessing the
forehead and hair; at Noyon they have a lock of the
hair, which is considered to be very authentic, as
well as that at Lucca, and many other places.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet in order to complete this collection, we must
go to the monastery of St Sylvester at Rome, where
the whole and real head of St John the Baptist will
be shown to us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poets tell us a legend about a king of Spain who
had three heads; if our manufacturers of relics
could say the same of St John the Baptist, it
would greatly assist their lies; but as such a fable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall not press them too hard by inquiring how
could this head be so divided and distributed, or
how have they procured it from Constantinople?
I shall merely observe, that either St John must
have been a miracle, or that those who possess so
many parts of his head are a set of the most audacious
cheats.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is more than this, they boast at Sienna of
possessing an arm of that saint, which is contrary,
as we have already said, to the statements of all the
ancient historians; and yet this fraud is not only
suffered, but even approved of, for in the kingdom
of Antichrist nothing is too bad which can serve to
keep people in a state of superstition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another fable has been invented respecting St
John the Baptist. When his body was burnt, they
say that the finger with which he had pointed out
our Lord Jesus Christ had remained whole and uninjured
by the fire. Now this story may easily be
refuted by the ancient historians, because Eusebius
and Theodoret distinctly state that the body had
already become a skeleton when the Pagans burnt
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it; and they certainly would not have omitted the
relation of such a miracle in their histories if there
had been any foundation for it, having been but too
eager to narrate such events even as are quite frivolous.
But supposing that this miracle had really
taken place, let us seek where this finger is now to
be found. There is one at Besançon in the Church
of St John the Great, a second at Toulouse, a third
at Lyons, a fourth at Florence, and a fifth at St
Jean des Aventures, near Maçon. Now I request
my readers to examine this subject, and to judge for
themselves whether they can believe, that whilst St
John's finger, which, according to their own tradition,
is the only remainder of his body, is at Florence,
five other fingers can be found in sundry other
places, or, in short, that six are one, and one is six.
I speak, however, only of those that have come to
my knowledge; but I make no doubt, if a careful
inquiry were made, that one might discover half a
dozen more of St John's fingers, and many pieces of
his head, besides those I have enumerated.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a>

There are many relics of another kind shown as
having belonged to St John the Baptist; as, for instance,
one of his shoes is preserved in the Church
of the Carthusians at Paris. It was stolen about
twelve years ago; but it was very soon replaced by
that sort of miracle never likely to cease so long as
there are shoemakers in the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At St John of the Lateran, at Rome, they boast of
having his haircloth mentioned in the Gospels. The

They have also at the same church the altar before
which he prayed in the desert, as if altars were
in those days erected on every occasion and in every
place. I wonder, indeed, that they have not ascribed
to him the saying of the mass.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At Avignon they show the sword with which he
was beheaded, and at Aix-la-Chapelle the sheet
which was spread under him at that time. Is it not
absurd to suppose that the executioner would spread
a sheet under one whom he was about to kill?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But admitting that this should be the case, how
have they obtained these two objects? Is it likely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the man who put him to death, whether a soldier
or executioner, should have given away his
sword and the sheet we have mentioned, in order
to be converted into relics?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
ST PETER AND ST PAUL.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is now time to speak of the apostles, and I shall
begin with St Peter and St Paul. Their bodies are
at Rome; one part of them in the church of St Peter,
and the other in that of St Paul. We are told that
St Sylvester weighed their bodies in order to divide
them into equal parts. Both their heads are preserved
also at Rome in St John of the Lateran. Besides
the two bodies we have just mentioned, many
of their bones are to be found elsewhere, as at Poitiers
they have St Peter's jaw and beard. At Treves
there are several bones of the two apostles. At Argenton
in Berri they have St Paul's shoulder, and
in almost every church dedicated to these apostles
there will be found some of their relics. At the
commencement of this treatise I mentioned that St
Peter's brains, which were shown in this town
(Geneva), were found on examination to be a piece
of pumice stone, and I have no doubt that many of
the bones considered to belong to these two apostles
would turn out to be the bones of some animal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At Salvatierra they have St Peter's slipper. I do
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not know what shape it is, or of what material it is
made; but I conclude it to be similar to the slippers
of the same apostle shown at Poitiers, and which are
made of satin embroidered with gold. It would seem
as if they had made him thus smart after his death
as a compensation for the poverty which he suffered
during his lifetime. Their bishops look now so showy
in their pontificals, that no doubt it would be thought
derogatory to the apostles' dignity if they were not
dressed out in the same style. They take, therefore,
figures which they gild and ornament all over, and
name them as St Peter or St Paul, forgetting that
it is well known what was the condition of these
apostles whilst in this life, and that they wore the
raiments of the poor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They show also at Rome St Peter's episcopal chair
and his chasuble, as if the bishops of that age had
thrones to sit upon. The bishops then were engaged
in teaching, consoling, and exhorting their flocks
both in public and private, setting them an example
of true humility, but not teaching them to set up
idols, as is done by those of our day. With regard
to his chasuble, I must say that it was not then the
custom to put on disguises, for farces were not at that
time performed in the churches as they are now.
Thus, to prove that St Peter had a chasuble, it is
necessary to show in the first place that he had
played the mountebank, as the priests do now whenever
they intend to serve God.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is, however, no wonder that they have given
him a chasuble since they have assigned an altar to
him, there being no more truthful foundation for the
one than for the other. It is well known what kind
of mass was said at that time. The apostles simply
celebrated the Lord's Supper, and this requires no
altar; but as to the celebration of the mass, it was
then not heard of, nor was it practised for a long
time afterwards.<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> It is, therefore, evident that those
who invented all these relics never expected contradiction,
or they would not have devised such audacious
falsehoods. The authenticity of St Peter's altar
at Rome (which I have just mentioned) is denied by
Pisa, that town pretending to possess the real one.
The least objectionable of St Peter's relics is undoubtedly
his staff, it being most probable that he
had made use of one during his travels, but unfortunately
there are two of them at Cologne and Treves,
each town claiming exclusive possession of the identical
one.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a>

THE OTHER APOSTLES.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall speak of the rest of the apostles together,
in order to get quicker over the matter, and
we will relate, in the first place, where their whole
bodies are to be found, that our readers, by comparison,
may be able to form their own opinions on the
subject. All know that the town of Toulouse boasts
of possessing the bodies of six, namely, St James
the Major (brother of St John), St Andrew, St James
the Minor, St Philip, St Simeon, and St Jude. At
Padua they have the body of St Matthias, at Salerno
that of St Matthew, at Orconna that of St Thomas,
in the kingdom of Naples that of St Bartholomew.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, let us reckon up those apostles who possess
two or three bodies. St Andrew has a duplicate at
Amalfi, St Philip and St James the Minor both
have duplicates at Rome, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad sanctos Apostolos</span></span>, St
Simeon and St Jude the same in St Peter's Church.
St Bartholomew enjoys an equal privilege at Rome,
in the church bearing his name. Here we have
enumerated six of them, each provided with two
bodies, and St Bartholomew has an additional skin
into the bargain, which is shown at Pisa.<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a> St
Matthew, however, outrivals them all, for besides the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
body at Padua, which we have before mentioned, he
has another at Rome in the church of St Maria
Maggiore, a third at Treves, and an additional arm
at Rome.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true that the bits and scraps of St Andrew's
body, scattered in various places, counterbalance, in
some measure, the superiority of St Matthias; for
he has at Rome, in St Peter's Church, a head, and
a shoulder in that of St Chrysostom, an arm at St
Esprit, a rib at St Eustache, I do not know how many
bones at St Blaise, and a foot at Aix in Provence.

Now, as St Bartholomew has left his skin at Pisa,
so he has left there a hand; at Treves he has also
some bones, of which I forget the number; at Frejus
a finger, and at Rome there are other of his bones;
so that, after all, he is not the poorest of the apostles,
others not having such a number of relics. St Matthew
and St Thomas are the poorest of all. The
first has only, besides his body at Salerno, which we
have mentioned, some bones at Treves, an arm in
the church of St Maria at Rome, and in that of St
Nicolas his head; though it may be that other of his

As they pretend, in their tales, that the body of
St John the Evangelist disappeared immediately
after it was deposited in the grave, so they cannot
produce any of his bones, and they therefore sought
for a compensation amongst his clothing, &amp;c. Thus
they show at Bologna the cup from which he was
forced to drink poison by order of the Emperor Domitian.
Probably owing to some wonderful process
of alchemy, the same cup exists also in the church
of St John of the Lateran at Rome.

St Anne, the mother of the Blessed Virgin, has

third at a town called after her name in Thuringhia.

Lazarus has, to my knowledge, three bodies, at
Marseilles, Autun, and Avalon. A protracted lawsuit
took place between the two last-named towns
concerning the validity of their respective claims to
the possession of the real body of this saint. Yet
after an immense expense, both parties may be said
to have gained their suit, for neither forfeited its title
to ownership. With regard to Mary Magdalene, she
owns but two bodies, one at Auxerre, and another
of very great celebrity, with its head detached, at St
Maximin, in Provence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Lazarus and his sisters ever went to preach in France;

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The individual who pierced the side of our Lord
on the cross has been canonised under the name of
St Longinus, and after having thus baptized him,
they have bestowed upon him two bodies, one of
which is at Mantua, and the other at Notre Dame

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same has been done with the wise men who
came to worship our Lord at the nativity. In the
first place they settled their number, telling us that
there were three. Now the Gospel does not mention
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
how many were present, and some eminent
ecclesiastical writers have maintained their number
to have been fourteen, as mentioned for instance in
that imperfect commentary on St Matthew which
is ascribed to Chrysostom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospel</span></em> calls them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wise men</span></em>, but
they have elevated them to the dignity of kings,
without bestowing on them, however, either kingdoms
or subjects. Finally, they have been baptized
under the names of Balthazar, Melchior, and Gaspar.
Now, supposing we concede to them these fables,
frivolous as they are, it is certain that the wise men
returned to the east, for the Gospel informs us of this,
and we may conclude that they died in their native
land, there being no reason for thinking otherwise.
Now, who transferred their bodies to the west, for the
purpose of preserving them as relics? It would be
quite ridiculous, however, for me to attempt seriously
to refute such a palpable imposture. Let Cologne
and Milan, both of which towns pretend to possess
relics of these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wise men</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kings</span></em>, decide this question

ST DIONYSIUS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St Dionysius is considered to be one of the most
celebrated of ancient martyrs, as a disciple of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apostles, and as the Evangelist of France. Occupying
such high rank, it is therefore very natural
that his relics should be so liberally dispersed; his
whole bodies are, however, only preserved at the
Abbey of St Dénis in France, and at Ratisbon in
Germany. About a century ago Ratisbon instituted
a lawsuit at Rome to prove that the body in its
possession was truly that of the saint, and the justice
of the claim was established by a decision of the
Papal Court, delivered in the presence of the French
Ambassador. And yet, any one so bold as to dare
to assert at St Dénis that theirs was not the real
body would run the risk of being stoned for blasphemy;
whilst those who oppose the claim of Ratisbon
are considered as heretics, rebellious to the
decision of the Holy See.<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>

ST STEPHEN.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole body of St Stephen is at Rome, his
head is at Arles, and his bones are in more than
three hundred places; and the Papists, as if to show
themselves to be the partisans of those who murdered
him, have canonized the stones with which he
was killed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be asked how these stones were obtained,
but to my mind this would be a foolish question, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stones may be picked up anywhere, without incurring
any trouble or expense in their transport. These stones
are shown at Florence, at the convent of the Augustine
monks at Arles, and at Vigan in Languedoc, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whoever will close his eyes and allow his understanding
to be set aside, may believe that these are
the identical stones with which St Stephen suffered
martyrdom, but whoever will exert his reason a little
cannot but laugh at this imposition. The Carmelite
monks of Poitiers discovered some of these stones
only fourteen years ago, to which they ascribed the
virtue of assisting women in the pains of travail; but
the Dominican monks, from whom a rib of St Margarita
which possessed the same virtue had been
stolen, were very indignant, and raised a great outcry
at the deception practised by the Carmelites, but
the latter gained the body by firmly maintaining
their rights.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
THE HOLY INNOCENTS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was not at first my intention to mention the
Holy Innocents, for if I were to enumerate a whole
army of their relics, it might always be said to me in
reply that history is not contradicted by that, as their
number has never been mentioned to us. I shall
not dwell, therefore, upon their multitude, merely
observing that they are to be found in every part of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the world. I would ask, however, how it came to
pass that their graves were discovered so long after
their massacre, since they were not considered as
saints when their murder by Herod took place?
And then, how were these numerous bodies conveyed
to the many places where they are now to be seen?
To these questions but one answer can be given—<span class="tei tei-q">“All
this occurred five or six hundred years after
their death.”</span> How can any but idiots believe such
things?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But supposing even that some of their bodies had
really been discovered, how came so large a number
of them to be transported to France, Italy, and Germany,
and to be distributed amongst so many towns
situated so far apart? This can only be a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wholesale</span></em>
deception.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sepulchres of these two saints were discovered
at Milan in the time of St Ambrose, as testified by
him. This fact is confirmed also by the evidence of
St Jerome, St Augustine, and several others; consequently
Milan maintains its possession of the real
bodies of these saints. Nevertheless, they are likewise
to be seen at Brissach in Germany, and in the
Church of St Peter at Besançon, besides an immense
number of different parts of their bodies scattered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
throughout the land, so that each of them must have
had at least four bodies.

ST SEBASTIAN.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This saint, from the wonderful power his remains
possessed of curing the plague, was put into requisition
and more sought after than many of his brother
saints, and no doubt this popularity was the cause of
his body being quadrupled. One body is in the
church of St Lawrence at Rome; a second is at
Soissons; the third at Piligny, near Nantes, and the
fourth at his birth-place, near Narbonne. Besides
these, he has two heads at St Peter's at Rome, and
at the Dominican church at Toulouse. The heads
are, however, empty, if we are to believe the Franciscan
monks of Angers, as they pretend to possess
the saint's brains. The Dominicans of Angers possess
one of his arms, another is at St Sternin, at
Toulouse, a third at Case Dieu in Auvergne, and a
fourth at Montbrisson. We will pass over the small
fragments of his body, which may be seen in so many
churches. They did not rest satisfied with this multiplication
of his body and separate limbs, but they
converted into relics the arrows with which he was
killed. One of these is shown at Lambesc in Provence,
another is in the Augustine convent at Poitiers,
and there are many others in different towns.

ST ANTHONY.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A similar reason has bestowed on St Anthony the
advantage of multiplication of his remains, he being
considered as an irrascible saint, burning up all those
who incur his displeasure; and this belief caused
him to be dreaded and reverenced. Fear creating
devotion, and producing also a universal desire to
possess his relics, on account of the profits and advantages
to be derived therefrom, Arles therefore had
a long and severe contest with Vienne (in France)
respecting the validity of the bodies of this saint
possessed by each of these towns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The issue was the same as in other similar disputes,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, matters remained in the same state of
confusion as before; for if the truth had been established,
both parties would have lost their cause.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides these two bodies, St Anthony has a knee
in the Church of the Augustines at Albi, and several
other limbs at Bourg, Maçon, Ouroux, Chalons,
Besançon, &amp;c.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

I must not forget to mention St Petronilla, St
Peter's daughter, who has a whole body at Rome, in
the church dedicated to her father, besides other
relics in that of St Barbara. This does not, however,
prevent her from owning another body in the Dominican
convent at Mans, which is greatly venerated
for the virtue it possesses of curing fevers. St Helena
has not been so liberally provided for. Besides
her body at Venice, she has but an extra head in the

her hollow in this respect; for she has a whole body at
St Jean d'Angely, and a head into the bargain at
Cologne, besides three separate limbs, and various
fragments at Mans, Tours, and Bergerat. The companions
of this saint are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the eleven thousand
virgins</span></em>, and although this is a respectable number,
yet it is still too small, considering that the remains
of these virgins are to be seen everywhere; for besides
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there being about one hundred cart-loads of their

the other dedicated to the saint in question, between
which a great dispute has been going on as to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I could quote an infinite number of similar cases.
I think that the exhibitors of these relics should at
least have made some arrangement amongst themselves
the better to conceal their barefaced impostures.
Something of this sort was managed between
the canons of Trêves and those of Liége about St
Lambert's head. They compounded, for a sum of
money, not to show publicly the head in their possession,
in order to avoid the natural surprise of the
public at the same relic being seen in two different
towns situated so near to each other. But, as I have
already remarked at the commencement of this treatise,
the inventors of these frauds never imagined
any one could be found bold enough to speak out
and expose their deceptions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be asked, how it came to pass that these
manufacturers of relics, having collected and forged
without any reason all that their imaginations could
fancy in any way, could have omitted subjects pertaining
to the Old Testament?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only reply I can give to this query is, that
they looked with contempt on those subjects, from
which they did not anticipate any considerable gain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still they have not entirely despised them, for they
pretend to have the bones of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, in the church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">St Maria supra Minervam</span></span>,
at Rome. They also boast of possessing, at St John
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Lateran, the ark of alliance, with Aaron's rod,
though the same rod is also at the Holy Chapel in
Paris, whilst some pieces of it are preserved at
Salvatierra. Moreover, at Bordeaux they maintain
that St Martial's rod, which is exhibited in the church
of St Severin, is no other than that of Aaron. It
seems, indeed, that they would wish with this rod
to perform another miracle; formerly it was turned
into a serpent, whereas now they would convert it
into three different rods! It is very likely that they
may have other relics of objects mentioned in the
Old Testament, but the few we have here alluded to
show that they have treated them much in the same
style as those belonging to Christian times.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I now beg to remind my readers of what I mentioned
at the beginning of this work, that I have
had no commissioners for visiting the numerous
churches of the different countries enumerated by
me, nor must my description be taken for a register
or inventory of all that can be discovered respecting
relics. I have mentioned about half-a-dozen towns
in Germany, but three in Spain I think, about
fifteen in Italy, and between thirty and forty in
France, and even of these few examples I have not
related all that I might concerning them. Now, let
us only imagine what a mass might be raised out of
all the relics which are to be seen in Christendom, if
they were collected and arranged together in proper
order. I speak, however, only of those countries which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we know and frequent; for it is most important to
observe that all the relics belonging to Christ and the
apostles which are displayed in the west are also to be
seen in Greece, Asia, and all other countries where
Christian Churches are in existence. Now, what are
we to say when the Eastern Christians assert their
claims?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we contradict them, alleging on our part that
the body of such a saint was brought to Europe by
merchants, that of another by monks, that of a third
by a bishop, that a part of the crown of thorns was
sent to a king of France by an emperor of Constantinople,
and another part was carried off in time of
war, and so on of every object of the kind, they
would shake their heads, and laugh at us! How
are such differences to be settled? In every doubtful
case we can only judge by conjecture, and, in following
this out, the adherents of the Eastern Churches
are sure of success, because their claims are more
probable than those of their opponents. It is indeed
a difficult point for the defenders of relics to settle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, I beseech and exhort, in the name of
God, all my readers to listen to the truth now clearly
displayed before them, and to believe that, by God's
especial providence, those who have endeavoured thus
to lead mankind astray have been rendered so blind
and careless as to neglect a proper concealment of
their deceptions, but that, like Midianites having
their eyes put out, they run one against another, for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we all know that they quarrel amongst themselves,
and mutually injure each other. Whoever is not
wilfully prejudiced against all reason must certainly
be convinced that the worship of relics, whether true
or false, is an abominable idolatry; yet should not
this even be the case with him, he must nevertheless
perceive the evident imposture, and whatever may
have been his former devotion to relics, he must lose
all courage in kissing such objects, and become entirely
disgusted with them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I repeat what I said at the commencement of this
treatise, that it would be most important to abolish
from amongst us Christians this pagan superstition
of canonising relics, either of Christ or of his saints,
in order to make idols of them; for this is a defilement
and an impurity which should never be suffered
in the Church. We have already proved that
it is so by arguments, and also from the evidence of
Scripture. Let those who are not yet satisfied look
to the practices of the ancient fathers, and conform
to their examples. There are many holy patriarchs,
many prophets, many holy kings, and other saints
mentioned in the Old Testament. God ordained at
that time the observance of more ceremonies than
are needed now. Even funerals were performed
then with more display than at present, in order to
represent symbolically the glorious resurrection,
especially as it had not then been so clearly revealed
by the Word of God as it is to ourselves.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Do we ever read in that book that these saints
were taken from their sepulchres as idols? Was
Abraham, the father of the faithful, ever thus raised?
Was Sarah ever removed from her grave? Were
they not left in peace, with the remains of all other
saints? But what is more conclusive, was not the
body of Moses concealed by God's will, in such a
manner that it never has been or can be discovered?
Has not the devil contended concerning it with the
angels, as St Jude says? Now, what was our Lord's
reason for removing that body from the sight of men,
and why should the devil desire to have it exhibited
to them? It is generally admitted that God wished
to put away from his people of Israel all temptation
to commit idolatry, and that Satan desired its introduction
amongst them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be said, however, that the Israelites were
inclined to superstition. I ask, how stands the case
now with ourselves? Is there not, without comparison,
more perversity in this respect amongst Christians
than there ever was amongst the Jews of old?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us call to mind the practice of the early church.
It is true that the first Christians were always anxious
to get possession of the bodies of the martyrs, lest
they might be devoured by beasts or birds of prey,
and decently to bury them, as we read was the case
with the bodies of St John the Baptist and St
Stephen. This solicitude was shown, however, in
order to inter them in their graves, and there to leave
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them until the day of the resurrection; but they did
not expose these remains to the sight of men for
their adoration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The unfortunate custom of canonising saints was
not introduced into the Church until it had become
perverted and profaned, partly by the folly and
cupidity of its prelates and pastors, and partly because
they were unable to restrain this innovation,
as people were seeking to deceive themselves by
giving their hearts to puerile follies, instead of to
the true worship of God. If we wish, in a direct
manner, to correct this abuse, it is necessary to abolish
entirely what has been so badly commenced and
established against all reason. But if it is impossible
to arrive at once at such a clear comprehension
of this abuse, let people at least have their eyes
opened to discern what the relics are which are
presented for their adoration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is indeed no difficulty for those who will
only exercise their reason, for amongst the numerous
evident impostures we have here mentioned,
where may we find one real relic of which we may
feel certain that it is such as is represented?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, all those that I have enumerated are
nothing comparatively to the remainder yet untold by
me. Even whilst this treatise is in the press, I have
been informed of many relics not mentioned in it; and
if a general visitation of all existing relics were possible,
a hundredfold more discoveries would be made.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I remember when I was a little boy what took
place in our parish. On the festival day of St
Stephen, the images of the tyrants who stoned him
(for they are thus called by the common people)
were adorned as much as that of the saint himself.
Many women, seeing these tyrants thus decked out,
mistook them for the saint's companions, and offered
the homage of candles to each of them. Mistakes
of this kind must frequently happen to the worshippers
of relics, for there is such confusion amongst
them that it is quite impossible to worship the bones
of a martyr without danger of rendering such honours
by mistake to the bones of some brigand or
thief, or even to those of a horse, a dog, or a
donkey.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And it is equally impossible to adore the ring, the
comb, the girdle of the Virgin Mary, without the
risk of adoring instead objects which may have belonged
to some abandoned person.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, those who fall into this error must do so
willingly, as no one can from henceforth plead ignorance
on the subject as their excuse.<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a>

The following extract from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesiastical Gazette</span></span>
of Vienna has been reproduced in an Extraordinary
Supplement of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</span></span>, of
Augsburg, for the 11th May 1854. I subjoin a
translation of it in a postscript, as an additional evidence
of the persecution to which the Greek Church
united with Rome has been subjected in Russia,
and which I mentioned on page <a href="#Pg161" class="tei tei-ref">161</a> of this work:—

in their reports to the Government, lists of
such individuals as were suspected to be Catholics at
heart; and if all the exaggerated accounts which had
been made of the Spanish Inquisition were true, they
would be thrown into the shade by the proceedings
that were adopted against the above-mentioned individuals.
And indeed it is an averred fact, that
many of them fell a victim to starvation, blows, and
other cruel treatment. The Catholic inhabitants of
Worodzkow were forced with stripes, by the Governor
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
and his satellites, to sign a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> petition,
expressing their ardent wish to be received into the
pale of the orthodox Russian Church. The names
of those who could not write were signed by others,
and whoever showed the slightest manifestation of
his desire to remain a Catholic, after having
performed this </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> act, was treated as one
guilty of high treason. The same proceedings
as at Worodzkow were adopted in a hundred
other places, whose </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> petitions were obtained
with bloody stripes of the knout. The unfortunate
petitioners were, in order to perform this
operation, dragged from their homes, sometimes
to a distance of 18 or 20 versts (1-½ verst to an English
mile), and those who steadfastly refused to sign
were treated by the Russian papas with the utmost
cruelty and indignity. They were put into irons,
barred up in cold prisons without any fire, starved,
thrown into large tubs filled with an icy and
stinking water, and most mercilessly beaten, so
that many, in order to escape from such torments,
signed the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> petition, with hearts
as bleeding as their bodies. Many succumbed under
these fearful persecutions, which were not much inferior
to that which the Christians had suffered under
the reign of Diocletian. The Papa Stratanovich
extorted the signatures made by the feverishly agitated
hands of the clerical victims, whilst his lay
associate, Waimainich Zokalinski, performed the same
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
charitable office to other unfortunate individuals.
Some of these miserable persons were reduced by
starvation and every kind of ill-treatment to such a
condition, that they were almost unconscious of what
they did in signing the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">voluntary</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> petitions for the
reception into the pale of the Russian Church, all
of which were obtained by more or less similar
means.</span></span>

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It appears from a great mass of documentary evidence,
containing the names of localities and persons,
that the proselytism of 1841 was carried out in the
following manner:—Military authorities, and Russian
papas or priests, visited Catholic villages, and
having called together the Catholic peasantry and
landowners of the neighbourhood, declared that they
must join the Russian Church, throwing into prison
those who resisted the summons. In the most part
of cases, a petition for this object was signed by some
hired wretches in the name of all the community, of
whom many often knew nothing about this business,
but when they behaved as Catholics, they were
punished, as guilty of high treason.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

this periodical contains many well-authenticated cases
of religious persecution against the Roman Catholics

that more than half a million of pilgrims went to worship
the holy coat of Treves in 1844, and that many wonderful stories about the
cures effected by that relic were related. Several of these stories are not
altogether without foundation, because there are many cases where imagination
affects the human body in such a powerful manner as to cause or cure
various diseases. It was therefore to be expected that individuals suffering
from such diseases should be at least temporarily relieved from their ailings
by a strong belief in the miraculous powers of the relic. Cases of this kind
are always noticed, whilst all those of ineffectual pilgrimage are never
mentioned.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_3" name="note_3" href="#noteref_3">3.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">A translation

them as soon as she believed that she could do it without inconvenience.
She struggled hard against the calends of January, after having for a considerable
time suffered these festivities; and when she saw that she could not succeed
in abolishing them, she decided to transport the beginning of the year from the
first of January to Easter, in order to break the Pagan customs.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_20" name="note_20" href="#noteref_20">20.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Author's

on the calends of January; Christmas was fixed at the same epoch. The Lupercalia,
a pretended festival of purification, took place during the calends of February;
the Christian purification (Candlemas) was celebrated on the 2d of February. The
festival of Augustus, celebrated on the calends of August, was replaced by that
of St Peter <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in vinculis</span></span>,
established on the 1st of that month. The inhabitants
of the country, ever anxious about the safety of their crops, obstinately retained
the celebration of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ambarvalia</span></span>; St Mamert established in the
middle of the fifth century the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rogations</span></span>, which in their form
differ very little from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ambarvalia</span></span>.
On comparing the Christian calendar with the Pagan one, it is impossible
not to be struck by the great concordance between the two. Now, can we
consider this concordance as the effect of chance? It is principally in the usages
peculiar only to some churches that we may trace the spirit of concessions with
which Christianity was animated during the first centuries of its establishment.
Thus, at Catania, where the Pagans were celebrating the festival of
Ceres after harvest, the church of that place consented to delay to that time the
festival of the Visitation, which is celebrated everywhere else on the 2d
July.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">F.

order to show with what facility the worship of Mary swept away in its progress
the remnants of Paganism which were still covering Europe:—Notwithstanding
the preaching of St Hilarion, Sicily had remained faithful to the ancient worship.
After the council of Ephesus, we see eight of the finest Pagan temples of that
island becoming in a very short time churches dedicated to the Virgin. These
temples were, 1. of Minerva, at Syracuse; 2. of Venus and Saturn, at Messina; 3.
of Venus Erigone, on the Mount Eryx, believed to have been built by Eneas;
4. of Phalaris, at Agrigent; 5. of Vulcan, near Mount Etna; 6. the Pantheon,
at Catania; 7. of Ceres, in the same town; 8. the Sepulchre of Stesichorus.—V.

different writers on the number of Christians in the Roman
empire at the time of Constantine's conversion greatly varies. The valuation
of Staudlin (<span class="tei tei-q">“Universal Geshichte der Christlichen Kirche,”</span> p. 41, 1833) at half of
its population, and even that of Matter (<span class="tei tei-q">“Histoire de l'Eglise,”</span> t. i. p. 120), who
reduces it to the fifth, are generally considered as exaggerated. Gibbon thinks
that it was the twentieth part of the above-mentioned population; and the
learned French academician. La Bastie (<span class="tei tei-q">“Memoires de l'Academie des Inscripter,”</span>
&amp;c.) believes that it was the twelfth. This last valuation is approved by
Chastel (<span class="tei tei-q">“Histoire de la Destruction du Paganisme en Orient,”</span> 1850, p. 36) as an
average number, though it was much larger in the East than in the West. The
celebrated passage of Tertullian's <span class="tei tei-q">“Apology,”</span> in the second century, where he
represents the number of Christians in the Roman empire to be so great, that it
would have become a desert if they had retired from it, is considered by Beugnot

it will not be uninteresting to my readers to know how the
Roman Catholic Church explains this prohibition, and which may be best seen
from the following piece of ingenious casuistry, by one of her ablest defenders in
this country:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Canon xxxvi. of the Provincial Council held in 305, at Eliberis, in
Spain, immediately refutes the error of Bingham. (Bingham maintained the same opinion on
the images which is expressed in the text.) The pastors of the Spanish
church beheld the grievous persecution that Diocletian had commenced to wage
against the Christian faith, which had for a lengthened period enjoyed comparative
repose, under the forbearing reign of Constantius Cæsar, father of Constantine the Great.
They assembled to concert precautionary measures, and amongst
other things, they determined that, in the provinces under their immediate jurisdiction,
there should be no fixed and immovable picture monuments, such as
fresco paintings or mosaics, no images of Christ whom they adored, nor of the
saints whom they venerated, on the walls of the churches which had been
erected and ornamented during the long interval of peace which the Christians
had enjoyed. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Placuit,’</span> says the council, <span class="tei tei-q">‘picturas in ecclesia esse non debere,
ne quod colitur et adoratur, in parietibus depingatur,’</span> (Con. Elib.,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">apud Labbeum</span></span>,
tom i. p. 972.) This economy was prudent and adapted to the exigency
of the period. The figures of Christ and of his saints were thus protected from
the ribaldry and insults of the Pagans. But this well-timed prohibition demonstrates,
that the use of pictures and images had already been introduced into the
Spanish church.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierurgia, or Transubstantiation, Invocation

be no doubt that the enactment in question proves that images were used at that
time amongst the Spanish Christians, as a law prohibiting some particular crimes
or offences shows that they were taking place at the time when it was promulgated;
but the opinion that the above-mentioned enactment was not a prohibition
of images, but a precautionary measure in their favour, must be supported
either by the other canons of the same council, which contain nothing confirmatory
of this opinion, or by the authority of some contemporary writer, and is without
such evidence quite untenable, and nothing better than a mere sophism, I have

says that an individual who was passionately fond of playing at nine-pins committed
a crime for which he was sentenced to be beheaded. He requested, as
a favour which was usually granted to culprits before their execution, to indulge
once more in his favourite game. This demand being conceded, he
began to play with such ardour that he entirely forgot his impending execution.
The executioner, who was present, got tired of waiting for the culprit,
and seizing a moment when he stretched his neck picking up a ball from
the ground, cut off his head. The culprit was, however, so keen in the pursuit
of his game, that he seized his own head, and having made with it a successful
throw, exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Haven't I got all the nine?”</span></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_81" name="note_81" href="#noteref_81">81.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">An old

of heaven; pease and carrots grow without being planted; asparagus is as
thick as a man's leg, and artichokes as big as a head. When it is a lent day,
the fishes arrive in shoals, and St Peter comes with his net to catch them, in
order to regale you. St Martha is the cook and St Urban the butler.”</span>—See Maury,

following description of this little idol is given by a well-known French
writer of last century:—<span class="tei tei-q">“This morning, when I was quietly walking along
a street towards the capitol, I met with a carriage, in which sat two Franciscan
monks, holding on their knee something which I was unable to distinguish.
Every body was stopping and bowing in a most respectful manner. I
inquired to whom were these salutations directed? <span class="tei tei-q">‘To the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bambino</span></span>,’</span> I was
answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘whom these good fathers are carrying to a prelate, who is very ill,
and whom the physicians have given up.’</span> It was then explained to me what
this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bambino</span></span> is. It is a little statue, meant for Jesus, made of
wood, and richly attired. The convent which has the good fortune of being its owner has no
other patrimony. As soon as any body is seriously ill, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bambino</span></span> is sent for,
in a carriage, because he never walks on foot. Two monks take him and
place him near the bed of the patient, in whose house they remain, living at his
expense, until he dies or recovers.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bambino</span></span> is always driving about; people sometimes fight at
the gate of the convent in order to get him. He is particularly busy during the summer,
and his charges are then higher, in proportion to the competition and the heat,
which I think is quite right.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dupaty, Lettres sur

and other young men acquire in the seminaries and ecclesiastical academies a
certain degree of theological learning, after which they indue the monacal dress,
and are inscribed on the rolls of some convent, without however remaining in it.
They enter the offices of bishops and archbishops to perform their personal as
well as clerical service. Their position becomes then exactly the same as that
of the military aides-de-camp of the Generals, and of the civil ones of ministers,
and it is from amongst them that bishops, archimandrites, abbots, &amp;c., are
chosen. It is a career like every other service in Russia. Several of these ecclesiastics
may have chosen their calling from a real devotion; the most part of
them are, however, driven into it by an immeasurable ambition, selfishness,
speculation, and vanity, the curse of the upper classes of
Russia.”</span>—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Studien über

church are reserved for the monastic or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">regular</span></em> clergy, whilst the secular
(who cannot take orders without being married) do not rise above the station of a
parish priest. This last-named function, which gives no prospects of promotion,
is generally left to such theological students as are not fit for any thing better,
and, with some few honourable exceptions, they are generally an ignorant and
drunken set, treated with very little respect by the upper classes. The following
anecdote, characteristic of the moral and intellectual condition of that class of
the Russian clergy, was related to the author by a friend who had resided for
some time in Russia. A landowner of the government of Kazan, Mr Bakhmetieff,
who was very fond of the pleasures of the table in the old style, was in the habit
of inviting to his revels the priests of the neighbourhood. Once, when his clerical
guests had got so drunk as to lose all consciousness, their host, who was
less overpowered by the effect of drink, determined to play them a practical
joke, by daubing their beards with melted wax. The distress of these poor fellows,
on awaking from their sleep, at this strange unction of their beards, was
very great, because it was impossible to get rid of the wax without greatly injuring
that hirsute appendage, upon which so much of their personal respectability
rests. They became the laughing-stock of their congregations, and the
story made a great noise over all the country.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_127" name="note_127" href="#noteref_127">127.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">The Greek

kerchief with the likeness of the face of Jesus Christ
imprinted on it, and covered with blood and sweat, was kept in a church
at Rome in the eleventh century, for it is mentioned in the brief of Pope
Sergius IV., dated 1011. We do not know what tales respecting this relic
were related at that time, but it appears that copies of it called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Veronies</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
a corruption of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">verum icon</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the true image,”</span> were sold; and no doubt this appellation
gave rise to the legend of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sancta Veronica</span></span> who wiped the face of
Christ with her kerchief as he was going to Calvary. There are many versions
of this legend, as for instance that it was this woman whom Christ had cured of
the bloody issue, whilst again it is maintained that she was no less a person
than Berenice, niece to King Herod. It is also related that after the dispersion
of the apostles, St Veronica went in company with Mary Magdalene, Martha, and
Lazarus, to Marseilles, where she wrought many miracles with her kerchief.
The Emperor Tiberius heard of these miracles, and having fallen ill, he summoned
Veronica to Rome. She cured him in a moment, and was rewarded
with great honours and rich presents. The remainder of her life was spent at
Rome in company with St Peter and St Paul, and she bequeathed the miraculous
kerchief to Pope St Clement. It must, however, be observed, that this legend
has not obtained the official approbation of the Roman Catholic Church, though
St Veronica is acknowledged and has a place in the calendar for the 21st of February;
and it is said she suffered martyrdom in France. With regard to the
large sudaries or sheets upon which the whole body of Jesus Christ is impressed,
and the absurdity of which Calvin has so clearly exposed, the most celebrated of
these is that at Turin. Its history is curious, inasmuch as it shows that the
efforts of enlightened and pious prelates to prevent idolatrous practices invading
their churches proved unavailing against that general tendency to worship
visible objects, so strongly implanted in corrupt human nature, that even in this
enlightened age we are continually witnessing such manifestation of its revival
as may be compared only to that of the dark period of the middle ages. The
most striking instances undoubtedly are those of the holy coat of Treves, and
the relics of St Theodosia, which have been recently installed at Amiens, with
great pomp, and in the presence of the most eminent prelates of the Roman
Catholic Church, who seem now to be as anxious to promote this kind of fetishism,
as some of their predecessors were formerly to repress the same abuse. But
let us return to our immediate subject—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">holy sudarium</span></span> of
Turin. It is a long linen sheet, upon which is painted in a reddish colour a double
likeness of a human body, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as seen from before and from
behind, quite naked with the
exception of a broad scarf encircling the loins. It is pretended that this relic was
saved by a Christian at the taking of Jerusalem by Titus, and it was preserved
for many centuries by the faithful.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 640 it was brought back to Palestine, from whence it was transferred to
Europe by the Crusaders. It was taken by a French knight named Geoffroi de Charny, who
presented it to the collegiate church of a place called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Liré</span></span>, which
belonged to him, and which is situated about three leagues from the town of
Troyes, in Champagne; the donor declaring, on that occasion, that this holy
sheet was taken by him from the infidels, and that it had delivered him in a
miraculous manner from a prison dungeon into which he had been cast by the
English.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The canons of that church, seeing at once the great profits to be derived from
such a relic, lost no time in exhibiting it, and their church was soon crowded
with devotees. The bishop of Troyes, Henri de Poitiers, finding however no
proofs of the authenticity of this relic, prohibited it to be shown as an object of
worship, and it remained unheeded for twenty-four years.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sons of Geoffroi de Charny, about the year 1388, obtained permission
from the Papal legate to restore this relic of their father's to the church of Liré,
and the canon exposed it in front of the pulpit, surrounding it with lighted
tapers, but the bishop of Troyes, Peter d'Arcy, prohibited this exhibition
under pain of excommunication. They afterwards obtained from the king,
Charles VI., an authorization to worship the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">holy sudarium</span></span> in the
church of Liré.
The bishop upon this repaired to court, and represented to the king that the
worship of the pretended sheet of Jesus Christ was nothing less than downright
idolatry, and he argued so effectually that Charles revoked the permission by
an edict of the 21st August 1389.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Geoffroi de Charny's sons then appealed to Pope Clemens VII., who was
residing at Avignon, and he granted permission for the holy sudarium to be
exhibited. The bishop of Troyes sent a memorial to the Pope, explaining the
importance attached to this so-called holy relic. Clemens did not, however,
prohibit the sudarium to be shown, but he forbade its being exhibited as the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> sudary of Jesus Christ. The canons of Liré, therefore, put aside their
sudary, but it reappeared in other places, and after being shown about in various
churches and convents it remained at Chambery in 1432, where nobody dared to
impugn its reality. From that time its fame increased, and Francis I., king of
France, went a pilgrimage on foot, the whole way from Lyons to Chambery, in
order to worship this linen cloth. In 1578 St Charles Borromeo having announced
his intention of going on foot to Chambery to adore the holy sudary,
the Duke of Savoy, wishing to spare this high-born saint the trouble of so long
a pilgrimage, commanded the relic to be brought to Turin, where it has since
remained, and where the miracles performed by it and the solemn worship paid
to it, may be considered as a proof that its authenticity is no longer doubted.

undoubtedly that one which the notorious Pope John XXIII., who was deposed
for his vices by the Council of Constance, had sold to the Venetians for the sum
of fifty thousand ducats; but as the people of Rome would not allow such a precious
relic to quit their city, the bargain was rescinded. The head was afterwards

Anthony is venerated, or rather worshipped, by the Eastern as well as
the Western Church, and he seems to have bestowed his favours upon each
with the utmost impartiality, for a body of his is shown at Novgorod, in Russia,
where a church, with a convent attached to it, is dedicated to him. The legend
concerning St Anthony's arrival at Novgorod is curious. It is said that this
saint, whilst at Rome, was commanded by an angel, in a dream, to go and convert
the inhabitants of Novgorod. In obedience to this angelic injunction, St
Anthony embarked on a millstone, and floated on this extraordinary craft down
the Tiber, passed over the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Baltic seas, and arrived
safely at the river Wolchow, upon which stream Novgorod is situated, having
accomplished the whole voyage in four days—a marvellous speed indeed, and
which completely shames all the wonders of modern steam navigation! The
date assigned to this wonderful voyage happens to be that of a few centuries
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em> St Anthony's death, but we suppose this too must be considered as
another miracle.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_159" name="note_159" href="#noteref_159">159.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Calvin is

the Church of the Twelve Apostles, and another at Hauteville, near Epernay, in
Champagne.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_160" name="note_160" href="#noteref_160">160.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">The legend
tells us that an English chief, after conquering and taking possession
of Lower Brittany, returned to his native land in search of wives for his
army and himself. He married Ursula, an English princess, and took eleven
thousand maidens as brides for his companions in arms. Ursula, whilst journeying
with this bridal train to join her husband, was driven by a storm into the
mouth of the Rhine, and arrived at Cologne. There they were beset by a party
of Huns, who murdered them all. Their bodies were discovered at Cologne
in the 16th century, and the remains of St Ursula, which at first were mixed
with those of her companions, were pointed out, by a miracle, for the special
veneration of the faithful. Several of these virgins have relics in various
parts of Europe, and they are distinguished by proper names, as, for instance,
St Ottilla, St Fleurina, &amp;c. &amp;c.. The origin of this absurd legend is ascribed by
some antiquarians to the following inscription found upon a
tomb:—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">St Ursula et XI. M. V.</span></span>,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et 11 martyres virgines</span></span>,
which, through ignorance or wilful deceit, has been converted into
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">millia virgines</span></span>—11,000 virgins. Other savans
believe that the inscription meant <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">St Ursula et Undecimilla,
martyres virgines</span></span>,”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Undecimilla</span></span>, which was the
proper name of a virgin martyr, was mistaken
by some ignorant copyist for an abbreviation of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">undecim millia</span></span>, 11,000.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_161" name="note_161" href="#noteref_161">161.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">It must
be remarked that many relics described in this Treatise were
destroyed during the religious wars, but particularly by the French Revolution.
